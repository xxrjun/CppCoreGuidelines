The aim of this document is to help people to use modern C++ effectively. By \"modern C++\" we mean effective use of the ISO C++ standard (currently C++20, but almost all of our recommendations also apply to C++17, C++14 and C++11). In other words, what would you like your code to look like in 5 years' time, given that you can start now? In 10 years' time?</p> <p>The guidelines are focused on relatively high-level issues, such as interfaces, resource management, memory management, and concurrency. Such rules affect application architecture and library design. Following the rules will lead to code that is statically type safe, has no resource leaks, and catches many more programming logic errors than is common in code today. And it will run fast -- you can afford to do things right.</p> <p>We are less concerned with low-level issues, such as naming conventions and indentation style. However, no topic that can help a programmer is out of bounds.</p> <p>Our initial set of rules emphasizes safety (of various forms) and simplicity. They might very well be too strict. We expect to have to introduce more exceptions to better accommodate real-world needs. We also need more rules.</p> <p>You will find some of the rules contrary to your expectations or even contrary to your experience. If we haven't suggested you change your coding style in any way, we have failed! Please try to verify or disprove rules! In particular, we'd really like to have some of our rules backed up with measurements or better examples.</p> <p>You will find some of the rules obvious or even trivial. Please remember that one purpose of a guideline is to help someone who is less experienced or coming from a different background or language to get up to speed.</p> <p>Many of the rules are designed to be supported by an analysis tool. Violations of rules will be flagged with references (or links) to the relevant rule. We do not expect you to memorize all the rules before trying to write code. One way of thinking about these guidelines is as a specification for tools that happens to be readable by humans.</p> <p>The rules are meant for gradual introduction into a code base. We plan to build tools for that and hope others will too.</p> <p>Comments and suggestions for improvements are most welcome.

Suitable for the general guide?

Realistically, we have to deal with a lot of old code:</p> <ul> <li>application code written before the guidelines were formulated or known</li> <li>libraries written to older/different standards</li> <li>code written under \"unusual\" constraints</li> <li>code that we just haven't gotten around to modernizing</li> </ul> <p>If we have a million lines of new code, the idea of \"just changing it all at once\" is typically unrealistic. Thus, we need a way of gradually modernizing a code base.</p> <p>Upgrading older code to modern style can be a daunting task. Often, the old code is both a mess (hard to understand) and working correctly (for the current range of uses). Typically, the original programmer is not around and the test cases incomplete. The fact that the code is a mess dramatically increases the effort needed to make any change and the risk of introducing errors. Often, messy old code runs unnecessarily slowly because it requires outdated compilers and cannot take advantage of modern hardware. In many cases, automated \"modernizer\"-style tool support would be required for major upgrade efforts.</p> <p>The purpose of modernizing code is to simplify adding new functionality, to ease maintenance, and to increase performance (throughput or latency), and to better utilize modern hardware. Making code \"look pretty\" or \"follow modern style\" are not by themselves reasons for change. There are risks implied by every change and costs (including the cost of lost opportunities) implied by having an outdated code base. The cost reductions must outweigh the risks.</p> <p>But how?</p> <p>There is no one approach to modernizing code. How best to do it depends on the code, the pressure for updates, the backgrounds of the developers, and the available tool. Here are some (very general) ideas:</p> <ul> <li>The ideal is \"just upgrade everything.\" That gives the most benefits for the shortest total time.   In most circumstances, it is also impossible.</li> <li>We could convert a code base module for module, but any rules that affects interfaces (especially ABIs), such as use <code>span</code>, cannot be done on a per-module basis.</li> <li>We could convert code \"bottom up\" starting with the rules we estimate will give the greatest benefits and/or the least trouble in a given code base.</li> <li>We could start by focusing on the interfaces, e.g., make sure that no resources are lost and no pointer is misused.   This would be a set of changes across the whole code base, but would most likely have huge benefits.   Afterwards, code hidden behind those interfaces can be gradually modernized without affecting other code.</li> </ul> <p>Whichever way you choose, please note that the most advantages come with the highest conformance to the guidelines. The guidelines are not a random set of unrelated rules where you can randomly pick and choose with an expectation of success.</p> <p>We would dearly love to hear about experience and about tools used. Modernization can be much faster, simpler, and safer when supported with analysis tools and even code transformation tools.</p>"},{"location":"appendix-c-discussion/","title":"Appendix C: Discussion {#S-discussion}","text":"<p>This section contains follow-up material on rules and sets of rules.

Some techniques for this are shown in the References. Here's a non-exhaustive list of options:</p> <ul> <li>Pass the buck: Just document that user code must call the post-initialization function right after constructing an object.</li> <li>Post-initialize lazily: Do it during the first call of a member function. A Boolean flag in the base class tells whether or not post-construction has taken place yet.</li> <li>Use virtual base class semantics: Language rules dictate that the constructor of the most-derived class decides which base constructor will be invoked; you can use that to your advantage. (See [Taligent94].)</li> <li>Use a factory function: This way, you can easily force a mandatory invocation of a post-constructor function.</li> </ul> <p>Here is an example of the last option:</p> <pre><code>class B {\npublic:\n    B()\n    {\n        /* ... */\n        f(); // BAD: C.82: Don't call virtual functions in constructors and destructors\n        /* ... */\n    }\n\n    virtual void f() = 0;\n};\n\nclass B {\nprotected:\n    class Token {};\n\npublic:\n    // constructor needs to be public so that make_shared can access it.\n    // protected access level is gained by requiring a Token.\n    explicit B(Token) { /* ... */ }  // create an imperfectly initialized object\n    virtual void f() = 0;\n\n    template&lt;class T&gt;\n    static shared_ptr&lt;T&gt; create()    // interface for creating shared objects\n    {\n        auto p = make_shared&lt;T&gt;(typename T::Token{});\n        p-&gt;post_initialize();\n        return p;\n    }\n\nprotected:\n    virtual void post_initialize()   // called right after construction\n        { /* ... */ f(); /* ... */ } // GOOD: virtual dispatch is safe\n    }\n};\n\n\nclass D : public B {                 // some derived class\nprotected:\n    class Token {};\n\npublic:\n    // constructor needs to be public so that make_shared can access it.\n    // protected access level is gained by requiring a Token.\n    explicit D(Token) : B{ B::Token{} } {}\n    void f() override { /* ...  */ };\n\nprotected:\n    template&lt;class T&gt;\n    friend shared_ptr&lt;T&gt; B::create();\n};\n\nshared_ptr&lt;D&gt; p = D::create&lt;D&gt;();    // creating a D object\n</code></pre> <p>This design requires the following discipline:</p> <ul> <li>Derived classes such as <code>D</code> must not expose a publicly callable constructor. Otherwise, <code>D</code>'s users could create <code>D</code> objects that don't invoke <code>post_initialize</code>.</li> <li>Allocation is limited to <code>operator new</code>. <code>B</code> can, however, override <code>new</code> (see Items 45 and 46 in SuttAlex05).</li> <li><code>D</code> must define a constructor with the same parameters that <code>B</code> selected. Defining several overloads of <code>create</code> can assuage this problem, however; and the overloads can even be templated on the argument types.</li> </ul> <p>If the requirements above are met, the design guarantees that <code>post_initialize</code> has been called for any fully constructed <code>B</code>-derived object. <code>post_initialize</code> doesn't need to be virtual; it can, however, invoke virtual functions freely.</p> <p>In summary, no post-construction technique is perfect. The worst techniques dodge the whole issue by simply asking the caller to invoke the post-constructor manually. Even the best require a different syntax for constructing objects (easy to check at compile time) and/or cooperation from derived class authors (impossible to check at compile time).</p> <p>References: [Alexandrescu01] \u00a73, [Boost], [Dewhurst03] \u00a775, [Meyers97] \u00a746, [Stroustrup00] \u00a715.4.3, [Taligent94]</p>"},{"location":"appendix-c-discussion/#discussion-make-base-class-destructors-public-and-virtual-or-protected-and-non-virtual","title":"Discussion: Make base class destructors public and virtual, or protected and non-virtual","text":"<p>Should destruction behave virtually?

If <code>Base</code>'s destructor is public and non-virtual (the default), it can be accidentally called on a pointer that actually points to a derived object, in which case the behavior of the attempted deletion is undefined. This state of affairs has led older coding standards to impose a blanket requirement that all base class destructors must be virtual. This is overkill (even if it is the common case); instead, the rule should be to make base class destructors virtual if and only if they are public.</p> <p>To write a base class is to define an abstraction (see Items 35 through 37). Recall that for each member function participating in that abstraction, you need to decide:</p> <ul> <li>Whether it should behave virtually or not.</li> <li>Whether it should be publicly available to all callers using a pointer to <code>Base</code> or else be a hidden internal implementation detail.</li> </ul> <p>As described in Item 39, for a normal member function, the choice is between allowing it to be called via a pointer to <code>Base</code> non-virtually (but possibly with virtual behavior if it invokes virtual functions, such as in the NVI or Template Method patterns), virtually, or not at all. The NVI pattern is a technique to avoid public virtual functions.</p> <p>Destruction can be viewed as just another operation, albeit with special semantics that make non-virtual calls dangerous or wrong. For a base class destructor, therefore, the choice is between allowing it to be called via a pointer to <code>Base</code> virtually or not at all; \"non-virtually\" is not an option. Hence, a base class destructor is virtual if it can be called (i.e., is public), and non-virtual otherwise.</p> <p>Note that the NVI pattern cannot be applied to the destructor because constructors and destructors cannot make deep virtual calls. (See Items 39 and 55.)</p> <p>Corollary: When writing a base class, always write a destructor explicitly, because the implicitly generated one is public and non-virtual. You can always <code>=default</code> the implementation if the default body is fine and you're just writing the function to give it the proper visibility and virtuality.</p>"},{"location":"appendix-c-discussion/#exception","title":"Exception","text":"<p>Some component architectures (e.g., COM and CORBA) don't use a standard deletion mechanism, and foster different protocols for object disposal.

If there's no way to safely back out using no-fail operations, then no-fail rollback is impossible to implement. If there's no way to safely commit state changes using a no-fail operation (notably, but not limited to, <code>swap</code>), then no-fail commit is impossible to implement.</p> <p>Consider the following advice and requirements found in the C++ Standard:</p> <p>If a destructor called during stack unwinding exits with an exception, terminate is called (15.5.1). So destructors should generally catch exceptions and not let them propagate out of the destructor. --[C++03] \u00a715.2(3)</p> <p>No destructor operation defined in the C++ Standard Library (including the destructor of any type that is used to instantiate a standard-library template) will throw an exception. --[C++03] \u00a717.4.4.8(3)</p> <p>Deallocation functions, including specifically overloaded <code>operator delete</code> and <code>operator delete[]</code>, fall into the same category, because they too are used during cleanup in general, and during exception handling in particular, to back out of partial work that needs to be undone. Besides destructors and deallocation functions, common error-safety techniques rely also on <code>swap</code> operations never failing -- in this case, not because they are used to implement a guaranteed rollback, but because they are used to implement a guaranteed commit. For example, here is an idiomatic implementation of <code>operator=</code> for a type <code>T</code> that performs copy construction followed by a call to a no-fail <code>swap</code>:</p> <pre><code>T&amp; T::operator=(const T&amp; other)\n{\n    auto temp = other;\n    swap(temp);\n    return *this;\n}\n</code></pre> <p>(See also Item 56. ???)</p> <p>Fortunately, when releasing a resource, the scope for failure is definitely smaller. If using exceptions as the error reporting mechanism, make sure such functions handle all exceptions and other errors that their internal processing might generate.

Making existing single-threaded code execute concurrently can be as trivial as adding <code>std::async</code> or <code>std::thread</code> strategically, or it can necessitate a full rewrite, depending on whether the original code was written in a thread-friendly way.</p> <p>The concurrency/parallelism rules in this document are designed with three goals in mind:</p> <ul> <li>To help in writing code that is amenable to being used in a threaded   environment</li> <li>To show clean, safe ways to use the threading primitives offered by the   standard library</li> <li>To offer guidance on what to do when concurrency and parallelism aren't giving   the performance gains needed</li> </ul> <p>It is also important to note that concurrency in C++ is an unfinished story. C++11 introduced many core concurrency primitives, C++14 and C++17 improved on them, and there is much interest in making the writing of concurrent programs in C++ even easier. We expect some of the library-related guidance here to change significantly over time.</p> <p>This section needs a lot of work (obviously).

In particular, non-intrusively signaling failure to construct an object requires an exception. Signaling errors in a way that cannot be ignored requires exceptions. If you can't use exceptions, simulate their use as best you can.</p> <p>A lot of fear of exceptions is misguided. When used for exceptional circumstances in code that is not littered with pointers and complicated control structures, exception handling is almost always affordable (in time and space) and almost always leads to better code. This, of course, assumes a good implementation of the exception handling mechanisms, which is not available on all systems. There are also cases where the problems above do not apply, but exceptions cannot be used for other reasons. Some hard-real-time systems are an example: An operation has to be completed within a fixed time with an error or a correct answer. In the absence of appropriate time estimation tools, this is hard to guarantee for exceptions. Such systems (e.g. flight control software) typically also ban the use of dynamic (heap) memory.</p> <p>So, the primary guideline for error handling is \"use exceptions and RAII.\" This section deals with the cases where you either do not have an efficient implementation of exceptions, or have such a rat's nest of old-style code (e.g., lots of pointers, ill-defined ownership, and lots of unsystematic error handling based on tests of error codes) that it is infeasible to introduce simple and systematic exception handling.</p> <p>Before condemning exceptions or complaining too much about their cost, consider examples of the use of error codes.

Where desirable, they can be \"instrumented\" with additional functionality (e.g., checks) for tasks such as debugging.</p> <p>These Guidelines use types from the standard (e.g., C++17) in addition to ones from the GSL.

Upgrading old systems is hard. However, we do believe that a program that uses a rule is less error-prone and more maintainable than one that does not. Often, rules also lead to faster/easier initial development. As far as we can tell, these rules lead to code that performs as well or better than older, more conventional techniques; they are meant to follow the zero-overhead principle (\"what you don't use, you don't pay for\" or \"when you use an abstraction mechanism appropriately, you get at least as good performance as if you had handcoded using lower-level language constructs\").

They do not simply define a subset of C++ to be used (for reliability, safety, performance, or whatever). Instead, they strongly recommend the use of a few simple \"extensions\" (library components) that make the use of the most error-prone features of C++ redundant, so that they can be banned (in our set of rules).</p> <p>The rules emphasize static type safety and resource safety. For that reason, they emphasize possibilities for range checking, for avoiding dereferencing <code>nullptr</code>, for avoiding dangling pointers, and the systematic use of exceptions (via RAII). Partly to achieve that and partly to minimize obscure code as a source of errors, the rules also emphasize simplicity and the hiding of necessary complexity behind well-specified interfaces.</p> <p>Many of the rules are prescriptive. We are uncomfortable with rules that simply state \"don't do that!\" without offering an alternative. One consequence of that is that some rules can be supported only by heuristics, rather than precise and mechanically verifiable checks. Other rules articulate general principles. For these more general rules, more detailed and specific rules provide partial checking.</p> <p>These guidelines address the core of C++ and its use. We expect that most large organizations, specific application areas, and even large projects will need further rules, possibly further restrictions, and further library support. For example, hard-real-time programmers typically can't use free store (dynamic memory) freely and will be restricted in their choice of libraries. We encourage the development of such more specific rules as addenda to these core guidelines. Build your ideal small foundation library and use that, rather than lowering your level of programming to glorified assembly code.</p> <p>The rules are designed to allow gradual adoption.</p> <p>Some rules aim to increase various forms of safety while others aim to reduce the likelihood of accidents, many do both. The guidelines aimed at preventing accidents often ban perfectly legal C++. However, when there are two ways of expressing an idea and one has shown itself a common source of errors and the other has not, we try to guide programmers towards the latter.</p>"},{"location":"in-introduction/#innot-non-aims","title":"In.not: Non-aims","text":"<p>The rules are not intended to be minimal or orthogonal. In particular, general rules can be simple, but unenforceable. Also, it is often hard to understand the implications of a general rule. More specialized rules are often easier to understand and to enforce, but without general rules, they would just be a long list of special cases. We provide rules aimed at helping novices as well as rules supporting expert use. Some rules can be completely enforced, but others are based on heuristics.</p> <p>These rules are not meant to be read serially, like a book. You can browse through them using the links. However, their main intended use is to be targets for tools. That is, a tool looks for violations and the tool returns links to violated rules. The rules then provide reasons, examples of potential consequences of the violation, and suggested remedies.</p> <p>These guidelines are not intended to be a substitute for a tutorial treatment of C++. If you need a tutorial for some given level of experience, see the references.</p> <p>This is not a guide on how to convert old C++ code to more modern code. It is meant to articulate ideas for new code in a concrete fashion. However, see the modernization section for some possible approaches to modernizing/rejuvenating/upgrading. Importantly, the rules support gradual adoption: It is typically infeasible to completely convert a large code base all at once.</p> <p>These guidelines are not meant to be complete or exact in every language-technical detail. For the final word on language definition issues, including every exception to general rules and every feature, see the ISO C++ standard.</p> <p>The rules are not intended to force you to write in an impoverished subset of C++. They are emphatically not meant to define a, say, Java-like subset of C++. They are not meant to define a single \"one true C++\" language. We value expressiveness and uncompromised performance.</p> <p>The rules are not value-neutral. They are meant to make code simpler and more correct/safer than most existing C++ code, without loss of performance. They are meant to inhibit perfectly valid C++ code that correlates with errors, spurious complexity, and poor performance.</p> <p>The rules are not precise to the point where a person (or machine) can follow them without thinking. The enforcement parts try to be that, but we would rather leave a rule or a definition a bit vague and open to interpretation than specify something precisely and wrong. Sometimes, precision comes only with time and experience. Design is not (yet) a form of Math.</p> <p>The rules are not perfect. A rule can do harm by prohibiting something that is useful in a given situation. A rule can do harm by failing to prohibit something that enables a serious error in a given situation. A rule can do a lot of harm by being vague, ambiguous, unenforceable, or by enabling every solution to a problem. It is impossible to completely meet the \"do no harm\" criteria. Instead, our aim is the less ambitious: \"Do the most good for most programmers\"; if you cannot live with a rule, object to it, ignore it, but don't water it down until it becomes meaningless. Also, suggest an improvement.</p>"},{"location":"in-introduction/#inforce-enforcement","title":"In.force: Enforcement","text":"<p>Rules with no enforcement are unmanageable for large code bases.

Each rule has an Enforcement section listing ideas for enforcement. Enforcement might be done by code review, by static analysis, by compiler, or by run-time checks. Wherever possible, we prefer \"mechanical\" checking (humans are slow, inaccurate, and bore easily) and static checking. Run-time checks are suggested only rarely where no alternative exists; we do not want to introduce \"distributed bloat\". Where appropriate, we label a rule (in the Enforcement sections) with the name of groups of related rules (called \"profiles\"). A rule can be part of several profiles, or none. For a start, we have a few profiles corresponding to common needs (desires, ideals):</p> <ul> <li>type: No type violations (reinterpreting a <code>T</code> as a <code>U</code> through casts, unions, or varargs)</li> <li>bounds: No bounds violations (accessing beyond the range of an array)</li> <li>lifetime: No leaks (failing to <code>delete</code> or multiple <code>delete</code>) and no access to invalid objects (dereferencing <code>nullptr</code>, using a dangling reference).</li> </ul> <p>The profiles are intended to be used by tools, but also serve as an aid to the human reader.

After all, the discussions about exceptions have been going on for 40+ years. Some languages cannot be used without exceptions, but others do not support them. This leads to strong traditions for the use and non-use of exceptions, and to heated debates.</p> <p>However, we can briefly outline why we consider exceptions the best alternative for general-purpose programming and in the context of these guidelines. Simple arguments for and against are often inconclusive. There are specialized applications where exceptions indeed can be inappropriate (e.g., hard-real-time systems without support for reliable estimates of the cost of handling an exception).</p> <p>Consider the major objections to exceptions in turn</p> <ul> <li>Exceptions are inefficient: Compared to what? When comparing make sure that the same set of errors are handled and that they are handled equivalently. In particular, do not compare a program that immediately terminates on seeing an error to a program that carefully cleans up resources before logging an error. Yes, some systems have poor exception handling implementations; sometimes, such implementations force us to use other error-handling approaches, but that's not a fundamental problem with exceptions. When using an efficiency argument - in any context - be careful that you have good data that actually provides insight into the problem under discussion.</li> <li>Exceptions lead to leaks and errors. They do not. If your program is a rat's nest of pointers without an overall strategy for resource management, you have a problem whatever you do. If your system consists of a million lines of such code, you probably will not be able to use exceptions, but that's a problem with excessive and undisciplined pointer use, rather than with exceptions. In our opinion, you need RAII to make exception-based error handling simple and safe -- simpler and safer than alternatives.</li> <li>Exception performance is not predictable. If you are in a hard-real-time system where you must guarantee completion of a task in a given time, you need tools to back up such guarantees. As far as we know such tools are not available (at least not to most programmers).</li> <li>The exception-handling run-time support takes up too much space.
