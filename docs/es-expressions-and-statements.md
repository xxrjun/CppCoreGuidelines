### <a name="Res-lib"></a>ES.1: Prefer the standard library to other libraries and to "handcrafted code"

##### Reason

Code using a library can be much easier to write than code working directly with language features, much shorter, tend to be of a higher level of abstraction, and the library code is presumably already tested.
The ISO C++ Standard Library is among the most widely known and best tested libraries.
It is available as part of all C++ implementations.

##### Example

    auto sum = accumulate(begin(a), end(a), 0.0);   // good

a range version of `accumulate` would be even better:

    auto sum = accumulate(v, 0.0); // better

but don't hand-code a well-known algorithm:

    int max = v.size();   // bad: verbose, purpose unstated
    double sum = 0.0;
    for (int i = 0; i < max; ++i)
        sum = sum + v[i];

##### Exception

Large parts of the standard library rely on dynamic allocation (free store). These parts, notably the containers but not the algorithms, are unsuitable for some hard-real-time and embedded applications. In such cases, consider providing/using similar facilities, e.g.,  a standard-library-style container implemented using a pool allocator.

##### Enforcement

Not easy. ??? Look for messy loops, nested loops, long functions, absence of function calls, lack of use of built-in types. Cyclomatic complexity?

### <a name="Res-abstr"></a>ES.2: Prefer suitable abstractions to direct use of language features

##### Reason

A "suitable abstraction" (e.g., library or class) is closer to the application concepts than the bare language, leads to shorter and clearer code, and is likely to be better tested.

##### Example

    vector<string> read1(istream& is)   // good
    {
        vector<string> res;
        for (string s; is >> s;)
            res.push_back(s);
        return res;
    }

The more traditional and lower-level near-equivalent is longer, messier, harder to get right, and most likely slower:

    char** read2(istream& is, int maxelem, int maxstring, int* nread)   // bad: verbose and incomplete
    {
        auto res = new char*[maxelem];
        int elemcount = 0;
        while (is && elemcount < maxelem) {
            auto s = new char[maxstring];
            is.read(s, maxstring);
            res[elemcount++] = s;
        }
        *nread = elemcount;
        return res;
    }

Once the checking for overflow and error handling has been added that code gets quite messy, and there is the problem remembering to `delete` the returned pointer and the C-style strings that array contains.

##### Enforcement

Not easy. ??? Look for messy loops, nested loops, long functions, absence of function calls, lack of use of built-in types. Cyclomatic complexity?

### <a name="Res-DRY"></a>ES.3: Don't repeat yourself, avoid redundant code

Duplicated or otherwise redundant code obscures intent, makes it harder to understand the logic, and makes maintenance harder, among other problems. It often arises from cut-and-paste programming.

Use standard algorithms where appropriate, instead of writing some own implementation.

**See also**: [SL.1](#Rsl-lib), [ES.11](#Res-auto)

##### Example

    void func(bool flag)    // Bad, duplicated code.
    {
        if (flag) {
            x();
            y();
        }
        else {
            x();
            z();
        }
    }

    void func(bool flag)    // Better, no duplicated code.
    {
        x();

        if (flag)
            y();
        else
            z();
    }


##### Enforcement

* Use a static analyzer. It will catch at least some redundant constructs.
* Code review

## ES.dcl: Declarations

A declaration is a statement. A declaration introduces a name into a scope and might cause the construction of a named object.

### <a name="Res-scope"></a>ES.5: Keep scopes small

##### Reason

Readability. Minimize resource retention. Avoid accidental misuse of value.

**Alternative formulation**: Don't declare a name in an unnecessarily large scope.

##### Example

    void use()
    {
        int i;    // bad: i is needlessly accessible after loop
        for (i = 0; i < 20; ++i) { /* ... */ }
        // no intended use of i here
        for (int i = 0; i < 20; ++i) { /* ... */ }  // good: i is local to for-loop

        if (auto pc = dynamic_cast<Circle*>(ps)) {  // good: pc is local to if-statement
            // ... deal with Circle ...
        }
        else {
            // ... handle error ...
        }
    }

##### Example, bad

    void use(const string& name)
    {
        string fn = name + ".txt";
        ifstream is {fn};
        Record r;
        is >> r;
        // ... 200 lines of code without intended use of fn or is ...
    }

This function is by most measures too long anyway, but the point is that the resources used by `fn` and the file handle held by `is`
are retained for much longer than needed and that unanticipated use of `is` and `fn` could happen later in the function.
In this case, it might be a good idea to factor out the read:

    Record load_record(const string& name)
    {
        string fn = name + ".txt";
        ifstream is {fn};
        Record r;
        is >> r;
        return r;
    }

    void use(const string& name)
    {
        Record r = load_record(name);
        // ... 200 lines of code ...
    }

##### Enforcement

* Flag loop variable declared outside a loop and not used after the loop
* Flag when expensive resources, such as file handles and locks are not used for N-lines (for some suitable N)

### <a name="Res-cond"></a>ES.6: Declare names in for-statement initializers and conditions to limit scope

##### Reason

Readability.
Limit the loop variable visibility to the scope of the loop.
Avoid using the loop variable for other purposes after the loop.
Minimize resource retention.

##### Example

    void use()
    {
        for (string s; cin >> s;)
            v.push_back(s);

        for (int i = 0; i < 20; ++i) {   // good: i is local to for-loop
            // ...
        }

        if (auto pc = dynamic_cast<Circle*>(ps)) {   // good: pc is local to if-statement
            // ... deal with Circle ...
        }
        else {
            // ... handle error ...
        }
    }

##### Example, don't

    int j;                            // BAD: j is visible outside the loop
    for (j = 0; j < 100; ++j) {
        // ...
    }
    // j is still visible here and isn't needed

**See also**: [Don't use a variable for two unrelated purposes](#Res-recycle)

##### Enforcement

* Warn when a variable modified inside the `for`-statement is declared outside the loop and not being used outside the loop.
* (hard) Flag loop variables declared before the loop and used after the loop for an unrelated purpose.

**Discussion**: Scoping the loop variable to the loop body also helps code optimizers greatly. Recognizing that the induction variable
is only accessible in the loop body unblocks optimizations such as hoisting, strength reduction, loop-invariant code motion, etc.

##### C++17 and C++20 example

Note: C++17 and C++20 also add `if`, `switch`, and range-`for` initializer statements. These require C++17 and C++20 support.

    map<int, string> mymap;

    if (auto result = mymap.insert(value); result.second) {
        // insert succeeded, and result is valid for this block
        use(result.first);  // ok
        // ...
    } // result is destroyed here

##### C++17 and C++20 enforcement (if using a C++17 or C++20 compiler)

* Flag selection/loop variables declared before the body and not used after the body
* (hard) Flag selection/loop variables declared before the body and used after the body for an unrelated purpose.

### <a name="Res-name-length"></a>ES.7: Keep common and local names short, and keep uncommon and non-local names longer

##### Reason

Readability. Lowering the chance of clashes between unrelated non-local names.

##### Example

Conventional short, local names increase readability:

    template<typename T>    // good
    void print(ostream& os, const vector<T>& v)
    {
        for (gsl::index i = 0; i < v.size(); ++i)
            os << v[i] << '\n';
    }

An index is conventionally called `i` and there is no hint about the meaning of the vector in this generic function, so `v` is as good name as any. Compare

    template<typename Element_type>   // bad: verbose, hard to read
    void print(ostream& target_stream, const vector<Element_type>& current_vector)
    {
        for (gsl::index current_element_index = 0;
             current_element_index < current_vector.size();
             ++current_element_index
        )
        target_stream << current_vector[current_element_index] << '\n';
    }

Yes, it is a caricature, but we have seen worse.

##### Example

Unconventional and short non-local names obscure code:

    void use1(const string& s)
    {
        // ...
        tt(s);   // bad: what is tt()?
        // ...
    }

Better, give non-local entities readable names:

    void use1(const string& s)
    {
        // ...
        trim_tail(s);   // better
        // ...
    }

Here, there is a chance that the reader knows what `trim_tail` means and that the reader can remember it after looking it up.

##### Example, bad

Argument names of large functions are de facto non-local and should be meaningful:

    void complicated_algorithm(vector<Record>& vr, const vector<int>& vi, map<string, int>& out)
    // read from events in vr (marking used Records) for the indices in
    // vi placing (name, index) pairs into out
    {
        // ... 500 lines of code using vr, vi, and out ...
    }

We recommend keeping functions short, but that rule isn't universally adhered to and naming should reflect that.

##### Enforcement

Check length of local and non-local names. Also take function length into account.

### <a name="Res-name-similar"></a>ES.8: Avoid similar-looking names

##### Reason

Code clarity and readability. Too-similar names slow down comprehension and increase the likelihood of error.

##### Example, bad

    if (readable(i1 + l1 + ol + o1 + o0 + ol + o1 + I0 + l0)) surprise();

##### Example, bad

Do not declare a non-type with the same name as a type in the same scope. This removes the need to disambiguate with a keyword such as `struct` or `enum`. It also removes a source of errors, as `struct X` can implicitly declare `X` if lookup fails.

    struct foo { int n; };
    struct foo foo();       // BAD, foo is a type already in scope
    struct foo x = foo();   // requires disambiguation

##### Exception

Antique header files might declare non-types and types with the same name in the same scope.

##### Enforcement

* Check names against a list of known confusing letter and digit combinations.
* Flag a declaration of a variable, function, or enumerator that hides a class or enumeration declared in the same scope.

### <a name="Res-not-CAPS"></a>ES.9: Avoid `ALL_CAPS` names

##### Reason

Such names are commonly used for macros. Thus, `ALL_CAPS` name are vulnerable to unintended macro substitution.

##### Example

    // somewhere in some header:
    #define NE !=

    // somewhere else in some other header:
    enum Coord { N, NE, NW, S, SE, SW, E, W };

    // somewhere third in some poor programmer's .cpp:
    switch (direction) {
    case N:
        // ...
    case NE:
        // ...
    // ...
    }

##### Note

Do not use `ALL_CAPS` for constants just because constants used to be macros.

##### Enforcement

Flag all uses of ALL CAPS. For older code, accept ALL CAPS for macro names and flag all non-ALL-CAPS macro names.

### <a name="Res-name-one"></a>ES.10: Declare one name (only) per declaration

##### Reason

One declaration per line increases readability and avoids mistakes related to
the C/C++ grammar. It also leaves room for a more descriptive end-of-line
comment.

##### Example, bad

    char *p, c, a[7], *pp[7], **aa[10];   // yuck!

##### Exception

A function declaration can contain several function argument declarations.

##### Exception

A structured binding (C++17) is specifically designed to introduce several variables:

    auto [iter, inserted] = m.insert_or_assign(k, val);
    if (inserted) { /* new entry was inserted */ }

##### Example

    template<class InputIterator, class Predicate>
    bool any_of(InputIterator first, InputIterator last, Predicate pred);

or better using concepts:

    bool any_of(input_iterator auto first, input_iterator auto last, predicate auto pred);

##### Example

    double scalbn(double x, int n);   // OK: x * pow(FLT_RADIX, n); FLT_RADIX is usually 2

or:

    double scalbn(    // better: x * pow(FLT_RADIX, n); FLT_RADIX is usually 2
        double x,     // base value
        int n         // exponent
    );

or:

    // better: base * pow(FLT_RADIX, exponent); FLT_RADIX is usually 2
    double scalbn(double base, int exponent);

##### Example

    int a = 10, b = 11, c = 12, d, e = 14, f = 15;

In a long list of declarators it is easy to overlook an uninitialized variable.

##### Enforcement

Flag variable and constant declarations with multiple declarators (e.g., `int* p, q;`)

### <a name="Res-auto"></a>ES.11: Use `auto` to avoid redundant repetition of type names

##### Reason

* Simple repetition is tedious and error-prone.
* When you use `auto`, the name of the declared entity is in a fixed position in the declaration, increasing readability.
* In a function template declaration the return type can be a member type.

##### Example

Consider:

    auto p = v.begin();      // vector<DataRecord>::iterator
    auto z1 = v[3];          // makes copy of DataRecord
    auto& z2 = v[3];         // avoids copy
    const auto& z3 = v[3];   // const and avoids copy
    auto h = t.future();
    auto q = make_unique<int[]>(s);
    auto f = [](int x) { return x + 10; };

In each case, we save writing a longish, hard-to-remember type that the compiler already knows but a programmer could get wrong.

##### Example

    template<class T>
    auto Container<T>::first() -> Iterator;   // Container<T>::Iterator

##### Exception

Avoid `auto` for initializer lists and in cases where you know exactly which type you want and where an initializer might require conversion.

##### Example

    auto lst = { 1, 2, 3 };   // lst is an initializer list
    auto x{1};   // x is an int (in C++17; initializer_list in C++11)

##### Note

As of C++20, we can (and should) use concepts to be more specific about the type we are deducing:

    // ...
    forward_iterator auto p = algo(x, y, z);

##### Example (C++17)

    std::set<int> values;
    // ...
    auto [ position, newly_inserted ] = values.insert(5);   // break out the members of the std::pair

##### Enforcement

Flag redundant repetition of type names in a declaration.

### <a name="Res-reuse"></a>ES.12: Do not reuse names in nested scopes

##### Reason

It is easy to get confused about which variable is used.
Can cause maintenance problems.

##### Example, bad

    int d = 0;
    // ...
    if (cond) {
        // ...
        d = 9;
        // ...
    }
    else {
        // ...
        int d = 7;
        // ...
        d = value_to_be_returned;
        // ...
    }

    return d;

If this is a large `if`-statement, it is easy to overlook that a new `d` has been introduced in the inner scope.
This is a known source of bugs.
Sometimes such reuse of a name in an inner scope is called "shadowing".

##### Note

Shadowing is primarily a problem when functions are too large and too complex.

##### Example

Shadowing of function arguments in the outermost block is disallowed by the language:

    void f(int x)
    {
        int x = 4;  // error: reuse of function argument name

        if (x) {
            int x = 7;  // allowed, but bad
            // ...
        }
    }

##### Example, bad

Reuse of a member name as a local variable can also be a problem:

    struct S {
        int m;
        void f(int x);
    };

    void S::f(int x)
    {
        m = 7;    // assign to member
        if (x) {
            int m = 9;
            // ...
            m = 99; // assign to local variable
            // ...
        }
    }

##### Exception

We often reuse function names from a base class in a derived class:

    struct B {
        void f(int);
    };

    struct D : B {
        void f(double);
        using B::f;
    };

This is error-prone.
For example, had we forgotten the using declaration, a call `d.f(1)` would not have found the `int` version of `f`.

??? Do we need a specific rule about shadowing/hiding in class hierarchies?

##### Enforcement

* Flag reuse of a name in nested local scopes
* Flag reuse of a member name as a local variable in a member function
* Flag reuse of a global name as a local variable or a member name
* Flag reuse of a base class member name in a derived class (except for function names)

### <a name="Res-always"></a>ES.20: Always initialize an object

##### Reason

Avoid used-before-set errors and their associated undefined behavior.
Avoid problems with comprehension of complex initialization.
Simplify refactoring.

##### Example

    void use(int arg)
    {
        int i;   // bad: uninitialized variable
        // ...
        i = 7;   // initialize i
    }

No, `i = 7` does not initialize `i`; it assigns to it. Also, `i` can be read in the `...` part. Better:

    void use(int arg)   // OK
    {
        int i = 7;   // OK: initialized
        string s;    // OK: default initialized
        // ...
    }

##### Note

The *always initialize* rule is deliberately stronger than the *an object must be set before used* language rule.
The latter, more relaxed rule, catches the technical bugs, but:

* It leads to less readable code
* It encourages people to declare names in greater than necessary scopes
* It leads to harder to read code
* It leads to logic bugs by encouraging complex code
* It hampers refactoring

The *always initialize* rule is a style rule aimed to improve maintainability as well as a rule protecting against used-before-set errors.

##### Example

Here is an example that is often considered to demonstrate the need for a more relaxed rule for initialization

    widget i;    // "widget" a type that's expensive to initialize, possibly a large trivial type
    widget j;

    if (cond) {  // bad: i and j are initialized "late"
        i = f1();
        j = f2();
    }
    else {
        i = f3();
        j = f4();
    }

This cannot trivially be rewritten to initialize `i` and `j` with initializers.
Note that for types with a default constructor, attempting to postpone initialization simply leads to a default initialization followed by an assignment.
A popular reason for such examples is "efficiency", but a compiler that can detect whether we made a used-before-set error can also eliminate any redundant double initialization.

Assuming that there is a logical connection between `i` and `j`, that connection should probably be expressed in code:

    pair<widget, widget> make_related_widgets(bool x)
    {
        return (x) ? {f1(), f2()} : {f3(), f4()};
    }

    auto [i, j] = make_related_widgets(cond);    // C++17

If the `make_related_widgets` function is otherwise redundant,
we can eliminate it by using a lambda [ES.28](#Res-lambda-init):

    auto [i, j] = [x] { return (x) ? pair{f1(), f2()} : pair{f3(), f4()} }();    // C++17

Using a value representing "uninitialized" is a symptom of a problem and not a solution:

    widget i = uninit;  // bad
    widget j = uninit;

    // ...
    use(i);         // possibly used before set
    // ...

    if (cond) {     // bad: i and j are initialized "late"
        i = f1();
        j = f2();
    }
    else {
        i = f3();
        j = f4();
    }

Now the compiler cannot even simply detect a used-before-set. Further, we've introduced complexity in the state space for widget: which operations are valid on an `uninit` widget and which are not?

##### Note

Complex initialization has been popular with clever programmers for decades.
It has also been a major source of errors and complexity.
Many such errors are introduced during maintenance years after the initial implementation.

##### Example

This rule covers data members.

    class X {
    public:
        X(int i, int ci) : m2{i}, cm2{ci} {}
        // ...

    private:
        int m1 = 7;
        int m2;
        int m3;

        const int cm1 = 7;
        const int cm2;
        const int cm3;
    };

The compiler will flag the uninitialized `cm3` because it is a `const`, but it will not catch the lack of initialization of `m3`.
Usually, a rare spurious member initialization is worth the absence of errors from lack of initialization and often an optimizer
can eliminate a redundant initialization (e.g., an initialization that occurs immediately before an assignment).

##### Exception

If you are declaring an object that is just about to be initialized from input, initializing it would cause a double initialization.
However, beware that this might leave uninitialized data beyond the input -- and that has been a fertile source of errors and security breaches:

    constexpr int max = 8 * 1024;
    int buf[max];         // OK, but suspicious: uninitialized
    f.read(buf, max);

The cost of initializing that array could be significant in some situations.
However, such examples do tend to leave uninitialized variables accessible, so they should be treated with suspicion.

    constexpr int max = 8 * 1024;
    int buf[max] = {};   // zero all elements; better in some situations
    f.read(buf, max);

Because of the restrictive initialization rules for arrays and `std::array`, they offer the most compelling examples of the need for this exception.

When feasible use a library function that is known not to overflow. For example:

    string s;   // s is default initialized to ""
    cin >> s;   // s expands to hold the string

Don't consider simple variables that are targets for input operations exceptions to this rule:

    int i;   // bad
    // ...
    cin >> i;

In the not uncommon case where the input target and the input operation get separated (as they should not) the possibility of used-before-set opens up.

    int i2 = 0;   // better, assuming that zero is an acceptable value for i2
    // ...
    cin >> i2;

A good optimizer should know about input operations and eliminate the redundant operation.


##### Note

Sometimes, a lambda can be used as an initializer to avoid an uninitialized variable:

    error_code ec;
    Value v = [&] {
        auto p = get_value();   // get_value() returns a pair<error_code, Value>
        ec = p.first;
        return p.second;
    }();

or maybe:

    Value v = [] {
        auto p = get_value();   // get_value() returns a pair<error_code, Value>
        if (p.first) throw Bad_value{p.first};
        return p.second;
    }();

**See also**: [ES.28](#Res-lambda-init)

##### Enforcement

* Flag every uninitialized variable.
  Don't flag variables of user-defined types with default constructors.
* Check that an uninitialized buffer is written into *immediately* after declaration.
  Passing an uninitialized variable as a reference to non-`const` argument can be assumed to be a write into the variable.

### <a name="Res-introduce"></a>ES.21: Don't introduce a variable (or constant) before you need to use it

##### Reason

Readability. To limit the scope in which the variable can be used.

##### Example

    int x = 7;
    // ... no use of x here ...
    ++x;

##### Enforcement

Flag declarations that are distant from their first use.

### <a name="Res-init"></a>ES.22: Don't declare a variable until you have a value to initialize it with

##### Reason

Readability. Limit the scope in which a variable can be used. Don't risk used-before-set. Initialization is often more efficient than assignment.

##### Example, bad

    string s;
    // ... no use of s here ...
    s = "what a waste";

##### Example, bad

    SomeLargeType var;  // Hard-to-read CaMeLcAsEvArIaBlE

    if (cond)   // some non-trivial condition
        Set(&var);
    else if (cond2 || !cond3) {
        var = Set2(3.14);
    }
    else {
        var = 0;
        for (auto& e : something)
            var += e;
    }

    // use var; that this isn't done too early can be enforced statically with only control flow

This would be fine if there was a default initialization for `SomeLargeType` that wasn't too expensive.
Otherwise, a programmer might very well wonder if every possible path through the maze of conditions has been covered.
If not, we have a "use before set" bug. This is a maintenance trap.

For initializers of moderate complexity, including for `const` variables, consider using a lambda to express the initializer; see [ES.28](#Res-lambda-init).

##### Enforcement

* Flag declarations with default initialization that are assigned to before they are first read.
* Flag any complicated computation after an uninitialized variable and before its use.

### <a name="Res-list"></a>ES.23: Prefer the `{}`-initializer syntax

##### Reason

Prefer `{}`. The rules for `{}` initialization are simpler, more general, less ambiguous, and safer than for other forms of initialization.

Use `=` only when you are sure that there can be no narrowing conversions. For built-in arithmetic types, use `=` only with `auto`.

Avoid `()` initialization, which allows parsing ambiguities.

##### Example

    int x {f(99)};
    int y = x;
    vector<int> v = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6};

##### Exception

For containers, there is a tradition for using `{...}` for a list of elements and `(...)` for sizes:

    vector<int> v1(10);    // vector of 10 elements with the default value 0
    vector<int> v2{10};    // vector of 1 element with the value 10

    vector<int> v3(1, 2);  // vector of 1 element with the value 2
    vector<int> v4{1, 2};  // vector of 2 elements with the values 1 and 2

##### Note

`{}`-initializers do not allow narrowing conversions (and that is usually a good thing) and allow explicit constructors (which is fine, we're intentionally initializing a new variable).

##### Example

    int x {7.9};   // error: narrowing
    int y = 7.9;   // OK: y becomes 7. Hope for a compiler warning
    int z {gsl::narrow_cast<int>(7.9)};    // OK: you asked for it
    auto zz = gsl::narrow_cast<int>(7.9);  // OK: you asked for it

##### Note

`{}` initialization can be used for nearly all initialization; other forms of initialization can't:

    auto p = new vector<int> {1, 2, 3, 4, 5};   // initialized vector
    D::D(int a, int b) :m{a, b} {   // member initializer (e.g., m might be a pair)
        // ...
    };
    X var {};   // initialize var to be empty
    struct S {
        int m {7};   // default initializer for a member
        // ...
    };

For that reason, `{}`-initialization is often called "uniform initialization"
(though there unfortunately are a few irregularities left).

##### Note

Initialization of a variable declared using `auto` with a single value, e.g., `{v}`, had surprising results until C++17.
The C++17 rules are somewhat less surprising:

    auto x1 {7};        // x1 is an int with the value 7
    auto x2 = {7};      // x2 is an initializer_list<int> with an element 7

    auto x11 {7, 8};    // error: two initializers
    auto x22 = {7, 8};  // x22 is an initializer_list<int> with elements 7 and 8

Use `={...}` if you really want an `initializer_list<T>`

    auto fib10 = {1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55};   // fib10 is a list

##### Note

`={}` gives copy initialization whereas `{}` gives direct initialization.
Like the distinction between copy-initialization and direct-initialization itself, this can lead to surprises.
`{}` accepts `explicit` constructors; `={}` does not. For example:

    struct Z { explicit Z() {} };

    Z z1{};     // OK: direct initialization, so we use explicit constructor
    Z z2 = {};  // error: copy initialization, so we cannot use the explicit constructor

Use plain `{}`-initialization unless you specifically want to disable explicit constructors.

##### Example

    template<typename T>
    void f()
    {
        T x1(1);    // T initialized with 1
        T x0();     // bad: function declaration (often a mistake)

        T y1 {1};   // T initialized with 1
        T y0 {};    // default initialized T
        // ...
    }

**See also**: [Discussion](#???)

##### Enforcement

* Flag uses of `=` to initialize arithmetic types where narrowing occurs.
* Flag uses of `()` initialization syntax that are actually declarations. (Many compilers should warn on this already.)

### <a name="Res-unique"></a>ES.24: Use a `unique_ptr<T>` to hold pointers

##### Reason

Using `std::unique_ptr` is the simplest way to avoid leaks. It is reliable, it
makes the type system do much of the work to validate ownership safety, it
increases readability, and it has zero or near zero run-time cost.

##### Example

    void use(bool leak)
    {
        auto p1 = make_unique<int>(7);   // OK
        int* p2 = new int{7};            // bad: might leak
        // ... no assignment to p2 ...
        if (leak) return;
        // ... no assignment to p2 ...
        vector<int> v(7);
        v.at(7) = 0;                    // exception thrown
        delete p2;                      // too late to prevent leaks
        // ...
    }

If `leak == true` the object pointed to by `p2` is leaked and the object pointed to by `p1` is not.
The same is the case when `at()` throws. In both cases, the `delete p2` statement is not reached.

##### Enforcement

Look for raw pointers that are targets of `new`, `malloc()`, or functions that might return such pointers.

### <a name="Res-const"></a>ES.25: Declare an object `const` or `constexpr` unless you want to modify its value later on

##### Reason

That way you can't change the value by mistake. That way might offer the compiler optimization opportunities.

##### Example

    void f(int n)
    {
        const int bufmax = 2 * n + 2;  // good: we can't change bufmax by accident
        int xmax = n;                  // suspicious: is xmax intended to change?
        // ...
    }

##### Enforcement

Look to see if a variable is actually mutated, and flag it if
not. Unfortunately, it might be impossible to detect when a non-`const` was not
*intended* to vary (vs when it merely did not vary).

### <a name="Res-recycle"></a>ES.26: Don't use a variable for two unrelated purposes

##### Reason

Readability and safety.

##### Example, bad

    void use()
    {
        int i;
        for (i = 0; i < 20; ++i) { /* ... */ }
        for (i = 0; i < 200; ++i) { /* ... */ } // bad: i recycled
    }

##### Note

As an optimization, you might want to reuse a buffer as a scratch pad, but even then prefer to limit the variable's scope as much as possible and be careful not to cause bugs from data left in a recycled buffer as this is a common source of security bugs.

    void write_to_file()
    {
        std::string buffer;             // to avoid reallocations on every loop iteration
        for (auto& o : objects) {
            // First part of the work.
            generate_first_string(buffer, o);
            write_to_file(buffer);

            // Second part of the work.
            generate_second_string(buffer, o);
            write_to_file(buffer);

            // etc...
        }
    }

##### Enforcement

Flag recycled variables.

### <a name="Res-stack"></a>ES.27: Use `std::array` or `stack_array` for arrays on the stack

##### Reason

They are readable and don't implicitly convert to pointers.
They are not confused with non-standard extensions of built-in arrays.

##### Example, bad

    const int n = 7;
    int m = 9;

    void f()
    {
        int a1[n];
        int a2[m];   // error: not ISO C++
        // ...
    }

##### Note

The definition of `a1` is legal C++ and has always been.
There is a lot of such code.
It is error-prone, though, especially when the bound is non-local.
Also, it is a "popular" source of errors (buffer overflow, pointers from array decay, etc.).
The definition of `a2` is C but not C++ and is considered a security risk

##### Example

    const int n = 7;
    int m = 9;

    void f()
    {
        array<int, n> a1;
        stack_array<int> a2(m);
        // ...
    }

##### Enforcement

* Flag arrays with non-constant bounds (C-style VLAs)
* Flag arrays with non-local constant bounds

### <a name="Res-lambda-init"></a>ES.28: Use lambdas for complex initialization, especially of `const` variables

##### Reason

It nicely encapsulates local initialization, including cleaning up scratch variables needed only for the initialization, without needing to create a needless non-local yet non-reusable function. It also works for variables that should be `const` but only after some initialization work.

##### Example, bad

    widget x;   // should be const, but:
    for (auto i = 2; i <= N; ++i) {          // this could be some
        x += some_obj.do_something_with(i);  // arbitrarily long code
    }                                        // needed to initialize x
    // from here, x should be const, but we can't say so in code in this style

##### Example, good

    const widget x = [&] {
        widget val;                                // assume that widget has a default constructor
        for (auto i = 2; i <= N; ++i) {            // this could be some
            val += some_obj.do_something_with(i);  // arbitrarily long code
        }                                          // needed to initialize x
        return val;
    }();

If at all possible, reduce the conditions to a simple set of alternatives (e.g., an `enum`) and don't mix up selection and initialization.

##### Enforcement

Hard. At best a heuristic. Look for an uninitialized variable followed by a loop assigning to it.

### <a name="Res-macros"></a>ES.30: Don't use macros for program text manipulation

##### Reason

Macros are a major source of bugs.
Macros don't obey the usual scope and type rules.
Macros ensure that the human reader sees something different from what the compiler sees.
Macros complicate tool building.

##### Example, bad

    #define Case break; case   /* BAD */

This innocuous-looking macro makes a single lower case `c` instead of a `C` into a bad flow-control bug.

##### Note

This rule does not ban the use of macros for "configuration control" use in `#ifdef`s, etc.

In the future, modules are likely to eliminate the need for macros in configuration control.

##### Note

This rule is meant to also discourage use of `#` for stringification and `##` for concatenation.
As usual for macros, there are uses that are "mostly harmless", but even these can create problems for tools,
such as auto completers, static analyzers, and debuggers.
Often the desire to use fancy macros is a sign of an overly complex design.
Also, `#` and `##` encourages the definition and use of macros:

    #define CAT(a, b) a ## b
    #define STRINGIFY(a) #a

    void f(int x, int y)
    {
        string CAT(x, y) = "asdf";   // BAD: hard for tools to handle (and ugly)
        string sx2 = STRINGIFY(x);
        // ...
    }

There are workarounds for low-level string manipulation using macros. For example:

    enum E { a, b };

    template<int x>
    constexpr const char* stringify()
    {
        switch (x) {
        case a: return "a";
        case b: return "b";
        }
    }

    void f()
    {
        string s1 = stringify<a>();
        string s2 = stringify<b>();
        // ...
    }

This is not as convenient as a macro to define, but as easy to use, has zero overhead, and is typed and scoped.

In the future, static reflection is likely to eliminate the last needs for the preprocessor for program text manipulation.

##### Enforcement

Scream when you see a macro that isn't just used for source control (e.g., `#ifdef`)

### <a name="Res-macros2"></a>ES.31: Don't use macros for constants or "functions"

##### Reason

Macros are a major source of bugs.
Macros don't obey the usual scope and type rules.
Macros don't obey the usual rules for argument passing.
Macros ensure that the human reader sees something different from what the compiler sees.
Macros complicate tool building.

##### Example, bad

    #define PI 3.14
    #define SQUARE(a, b) (a * b)

Even if we hadn't left a well-known bug in `SQUARE` there are much better behaved alternatives; for example:

    constexpr double pi = 3.14;
    template<typename T> T square(T a, T b) { return a * b; }

##### Enforcement

Scream when you see a macro that isn't just used for source control (e.g., `#ifdef`)

### <a name="Res-ALL_CAPS"></a>ES.32: Use `ALL_CAPS` for all macro names

##### Reason

Convention. Readability. Distinguishing macros.

##### Example

    #define forever for (;;)   /* very BAD */

    #define FOREVER for (;;)   /* Still evil, but at least visible to humans */

##### Enforcement

Scream when you see a lower case macro.

### <a name="Res-MACROS"></a>ES.33: If you must use macros, give them unique names

##### Reason

Macros do not obey scope rules.

##### Example

    #define MYCHAR        /* BAD, will eventually clash with someone else's MYCHAR*/

    #define ZCORP_CHAR    /* Still evil, but less likely to clash */

##### Note

Avoid macros if you can: [ES.30](#Res-macros), [ES.31](#Res-macros2), and [ES.32](#Res-ALL_CAPS).
However, there are billions of lines of code littered with macros and a long tradition for using and overusing macros.
If you are forced to use macros, use long names and supposedly unique prefixes (e.g., your organization's name) to lower the likelihood of a clash.

##### Enforcement

Warn against short macro names.

### <a name="Res-ellipses"></a> ES.34: Don't define a (C-style) variadic function

##### Reason

Not type safe.
Requires messy cast-and-macro-laden code to get working right.

##### Example

    #include <cstdarg>

    // "severity" followed by a zero-terminated list of char*s; write the C-style strings to cerr
    void error(int severity ...)
    {
        va_list ap;             // a magic type for holding arguments
        va_start(ap, severity); // arg startup: "severity" is the first argument of error()

        for (;;) {
            // treat the next var as a char*; no checking: a cast in disguise
            char* p = va_arg(ap, char*);
            if (!p) break;
            cerr << p << ' ';
        }

        va_end(ap);             // arg cleanup (don't forget this)

        cerr << '\n';
        if (severity) exit(severity);
    }

    void use()
    {
        error(7, "this", "is", "an", "error", nullptr);
        error(7); // crash
        error(7, "this", "is", "an", "error");  // crash
        const char* is = "is";
        string an = "an";
        error(7, "this", is, an, "error"); // crash
    }

**Alternative**: Overloading. Templates. Variadic templates.

    #include <iostream>

    void error(int severity)
    {
        std::cerr << '\n';
        std::exit(severity);
    }

    template<typename T, typename... Ts>
    constexpr void error(int severity, T head, Ts... tail)
    {
        std::cerr << head;
        error(severity, tail...);
    }

    void use()
    {
        error(7); // No crash!
        error(5, "this", "is", "not", "an", "error"); // No crash!

        std::string an = "an";
        error(7, "this", "is", "not", an, "error"); // No crash!

        error(5, "oh", "no", nullptr); // Compile error! No need for nullptr.
    }


##### Note

This is basically the way `printf` is implemented.

##### Enforcement

* Flag definitions of C-style variadic functions.
* Flag `#include <cstdarg>` and `#include <stdarg.h>`


## ES.expr: Expressions

Expressions manipulate values.

### <a name="Res-complicated"></a>ES.40: Avoid complicated expressions

##### Reason

Complicated expressions are error-prone.

##### Example

    // bad: assignment hidden in subexpression
    while ((c = getc()) != -1)

    // bad: two non-local variables assigned in sub-expressions
    while ((cin >> c1, cin >> c2), c1 == c2)

    // better, but possibly still too complicated
    for (char c1, c2; cin >> c1 >> c2 && c1 == c2;)

    // OK: if i and j are not aliased
    int x = ++i + ++j;

    // OK: if i != j and i != k
    v[i] = v[j] + v[k];

    // bad: multiple assignments "hidden" in subexpressions
    x = a + (b = f()) + (c = g()) * 7;

    // bad: relies on commonly misunderstood precedence rules
    x = a & b + c * d && e ^ f == 7;

    // bad: undefined behavior
    x = x++ + x++ + ++x;

Some of these expressions are unconditionally bad (e.g., they rely on undefined behavior). Others are simply so complicated and/or unusual that even good programmers could misunderstand them or overlook a problem when in a hurry.

##### Note

C++17 tightens up the rules for the order of evaluation
(left-to-right except right-to-left in assignments, and the order of evaluation of function arguments is unspecified; [see ES.43](#Res-order)),
but that doesn't change the fact that complicated expressions are potentially confusing.

##### Note

A programmer should know and use the basic rules for expressions.

##### Example

    x = k * y + z;             // OK

    auto t1 = k * y;           // bad: unnecessarily verbose
    x = t1 + z;

    if (0 <= x && x < max)   // OK

    auto t1 = 0 <= x;        // bad: unnecessarily verbose
    auto t2 = x < max;
    if (t1 && t2)            // ...

##### Enforcement

Tricky. How complicated must an expression be to be considered complicated? Writing computations as statements with one operation each is also confusing. Things to consider:

* side effects: side effects on multiple non-local variables (for some definition of non-local) can be suspect, especially if the side effects are in separate subexpressions
* writes to aliased variables
* more than N operators (and what should N be?)
* reliance of subtle precedence rules
* uses undefined behavior (can we catch all undefined behavior?)
* implementation defined behavior?
* ???

### <a name="Res-parens"></a>ES.41: If in doubt about operator precedence, parenthesize

##### Reason

Avoid errors. Readability. Not everyone has the operator table memorized.

##### Example

    const unsigned int flag = 2;
    unsigned int a = flag;

    if (a & flag != 0)  // bad: means a&(flag != 0)

Note: We recommend that programmers know their precedence table for the arithmetic operations, the logical operations, but consider mixing bitwise logical operations with other operators in need of parentheses.

    if ((a & flag) != 0)  // OK: works as intended

##### Note

You should know enough not to need parentheses for:

    if (a < 0 || a <= max) {
        // ...
    }

##### Enforcement

* Flag combinations of bitwise-logical operators and other operators.
* Flag assignment operators not as the leftmost operator.
* ???

### <a name="Res-ptr"></a>ES.42: Keep use of pointers simple and straightforward

##### Reason

Complicated pointer manipulation is a major source of errors.

##### Note

Use `gsl::span` instead.
Pointers should [only refer to single objects](#Ri-array).
Pointer arithmetic is fragile and easy to get wrong, the source of many, many bad bugs and security violations.
`span` is a bounds-checked, safe type for accessing arrays of data.
Access into an array with known bounds using a constant as a subscript can be validated by the compiler.

##### Example, bad

    void f(int* p, int count)
    {
        if (count < 2) return;

        int* q = p + 1;    // BAD

        ptrdiff_t d;
        int n;
        d = (p - &n);      // OK
        d = (q - p);       // OK

        int n = *p++;      // BAD

        if (count < 6) return;

        p[4] = 1;          // BAD

        p[count - 1] = 2;  // BAD

        use(&p[0], 3);     // BAD
    }

##### Example, good

    void f(span<int> a) // BETTER: use span in the function declaration
    {
        if (a.size() < 2) return;

        int n = a[0];      // OK

        span<int> q = a.subspan(1); // OK

        if (a.size() < 6) return;

        a[4] = 1;          // OK

        a[a.size() - 1] = 2;  // OK

        use(a.data(), 3);  // OK
    }

##### Note

Subscripting with a variable is difficult for both tools and humans to validate as safe.
`span` is a run-time bounds-checked, safe type for accessing arrays of data.
`at()` is another alternative that ensures single accesses are bounds-checked.
If iterators are needed to access an array, use the iterators from a `span` constructed over the array.

##### Example, bad

    void f(array<int, 10> a, int pos)
    {
        a[pos / 2] = 1; // BAD
        a[pos - 1] = 2; // BAD
        a[-1] = 3;    // BAD (but easily caught by tools) -- no replacement, just don't do this
        a[10] = 4;    // BAD (but easily caught by tools) -- no replacement, just don't do this
    }

##### Example, good

Use a `span`:

    void f1(span<int, 10> a, int pos) // A1: Change parameter type to use span
    {
        a[pos / 2] = 1; // OK
        a[pos - 1] = 2; // OK
    }

    void f2(array<int, 10> arr, int pos) // A2: Add local span and use that
    {
        span<int> a = {arr.data(), pos};
        a[pos / 2] = 1; // OK
        a[pos - 1] = 2; // OK
    }

Use `at()`:

    void f3(array<int, 10> a, int pos) // ALTERNATIVE B: Use at() for access
    {
        at(a, pos / 2) = 1; // OK
        at(a, pos - 1) = 2; // OK
    }

##### Example, bad

    void f()
    {
        int arr[COUNT];
        for (int i = 0; i < COUNT; ++i)
            arr[i] = i; // BAD, cannot use non-constant indexer
    }

##### Example, good

Use a `span`:

    void f1()
    {
        int arr[COUNT];
        span<int> av = arr;
        for (int i = 0; i < COUNT; ++i)
            av[i] = i;
    }

Use a `span` and range-`for`:

    void f1a()
    {
         int arr[COUNT];
         span<int, COUNT> av = arr;
         int i = 0;
         for (auto& e : av)
             e = i++;
    }

Use `at()` for access:

    void f2()
    {
        int arr[COUNT];
        for (int i = 0; i < COUNT; ++i)
            at(arr, i) = i;
    }

Use a range-`for`:

    void f3()
    {
        int arr[COUNT];
        int i = 0;
        for (auto& e : arr)
             e = i++;
    }

##### Note

Tooling can offer rewrites of array accesses that involve dynamic index expressions to use `at()` instead:

    static int a[10];

    void f(int i, int j)
    {
        a[i + j] = 12;      // BAD, could be rewritten as ...
        at(a, i + j) = 12;  // OK -- bounds-checked
    }

##### Example

Turning an array into a pointer (as the language does essentially always) removes opportunities for checking, so avoid it

    void g(int* p);

    void f()
    {
        int a[5];
        g(a);        // BAD: are we trying to pass an array?
        g(&a[0]);    // OK: passing one object
    }

If you want to pass an array, say so:

    void g(int* p, size_t length);  // old (dangerous) code

    void g1(span<int> av); // BETTER: get g() changed.

    void f2()
    {
        int a[5];
        span<int> av = a;

        g(av.data(), av.size());   // OK, if you have no choice
        g1(a);                     // OK -- no decay here, instead use implicit span ctor
    }

##### Enforcement

* Flag any arithmetic operation on an expression of pointer type that results in a value of pointer type.
* Flag any indexing expression on an expression or variable of array type (either static array or `std::array`) where the indexer is not a compile-time constant expression with a value between `0` and the upper bound of the array.
* Flag any expression that would rely on implicit conversion of an array type to a pointer type.

This rule is part of the [bounds-safety profile](#SS-bounds).


### <a name="Res-order"></a>ES.43: Avoid expressions with undefined order of evaluation

##### Reason

You have no idea what such code does. Portability.
Even if it does something sensible for you, it might do something different on another compiler (e.g., the next release of your compiler) or with a different optimizer setting.

##### Note

C++17 tightens up the rules for the order of evaluation:
left-to-right except right-to-left in assignments, and the order of evaluation of function arguments is unspecified.

However, remember that your code might be compiled with a pre-C++17 compiler (e.g., through cut-and-paste) so don't be too clever.

##### Example

    v[i] = ++i;   //  the result is undefined

A good rule of thumb is that you should not read a value twice in an expression where you write to it.

##### Enforcement

Can be detected by a good analyzer.

### <a name="Res-order-fct"></a>ES.44: Don't depend on order of evaluation of function arguments

##### Reason

Because that order is unspecified.

##### Note

C++17 tightens up the rules for the order of evaluation, but the order of evaluation of function arguments is still unspecified.

##### Example

    int i = 0;
    f(++i, ++i);

Before C++17, the behavior is undefined, so the behavior could be anything (e.g., `f(2, 2)`).
Since C++17, this code does not have undefined behavior, but it is still not specified which argument is evaluated first. The call will be `f(1, 2)` or `f(2, 1)`, but you don't know which.

##### Example

Overloaded operators can lead to order of evaluation problems:

    f1()->m(f2());          // m(f1(), f2())
    cout << f1() << f2();   // operator<<(operator<<(cout, f1()), f2())

In C++17, these examples work as expected (left to right) and assignments are evaluated right to left (just as ='s binding is right-to-left)

    f1() = f2();    // undefined behavior in C++14; in C++17, f2() is evaluated before f1()

##### Enforcement

Can be detected by a good analyzer.

### <a name="Res-magic"></a>ES.45: Avoid "magic constants"; use symbolic constants

##### Reason

Unnamed constants embedded in expressions are easily overlooked and often hard to understand:

##### Example

    for (int m = 1; m <= 12; ++m)   // don't: magic constant 12
        cout << month[m] << '\n';

No, we don't all know that there are 12 months, numbered 1..12, in a year. Better:

    // months are indexed 1..12
    constexpr int first_month = 1;
    constexpr int last_month = 12;

    for (int m = first_month; m <= last_month; ++m)   // better
        cout << month[m] << '\n';

Better still, don't expose constants:

    for (auto m : month)
        cout << m << '\n';

##### Enforcement

Flag literals in code. Give a pass to `0`, `1`, `nullptr`, `\n`, `""`, and others on a positive list.

### <a name="Res-narrowing"></a>ES.46: Avoid lossy (narrowing, truncating) arithmetic conversions

##### Reason

A narrowing conversion destroys information, often unexpectedly so.

##### Example, bad

A key example is basic narrowing:

    double d = 7.9;
    int i = d;    // bad: narrowing: i becomes 7
    i = (int) d;  // bad: we're going to claim this is still not explicit enough

    void f(int x, long y, double d)
    {
        char c1 = x;   // bad: narrowing
        char c2 = y;   // bad: narrowing
        char c3 = d;   // bad: narrowing
    }

##### Note

The guidelines support library offers a `narrow_cast` operation for specifying that narrowing is acceptable and a `narrow` ("narrow if") that throws an exception if a narrowing would throw away legal values:

    i = gsl::narrow_cast<int>(d);   // OK (you asked for it): narrowing: i becomes 7
    i = gsl::narrow<int>(d);        // OK: throws narrowing_error

We also include lossy arithmetic casts, such as from a negative floating point type to an unsigned integral type:

    double d = -7.9;
    unsigned u = 0;

    u = d;                               // bad: narrowing
    u = gsl::narrow_cast<unsigned>(d);   // OK (you asked for it): u becomes 4294967289
    u = gsl::narrow<unsigned>(d);        // OK: throws narrowing_error

##### Note

This rule does not apply to [contextual conversions to bool](https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/language/implicit_conversion#Contextual_conversions):

    if (ptr) do_something(*ptr);   // OK: ptr is used as a condition
    bool b = ptr;                  // bad: narrowing

##### Enforcement

A good analyzer can detect all narrowing conversions. However, flagging all narrowing conversions will lead to a lot of false positives. Suggestions:

* Flag all floating-point to integer conversions (maybe only `float`->`char` and `double`->`int`. Here be dragons! we need data).
* Flag all `long`->`char` (I suspect `int`->`char` is very common. Here be dragons! we need data).
* Consider narrowing conversions for function arguments especially suspect.

### <a name="Res-nullptr"></a>ES.47: Use `nullptr` rather than `0` or `NULL`

##### Reason

Readability. Minimize surprises: `nullptr` cannot be confused with an
`int`. `nullptr` also has a well-specified (very restrictive) type, and thus
works in more scenarios where type deduction might do the wrong thing on `NULL`
or `0`.

##### Example

Consider:

    void f(int);
    void f(char*);
    f(0);         // call f(int)
    f(nullptr);   // call f(char*)

##### Enforcement

Flag uses of `0` and `NULL` for pointers. The transformation might be helped by simple program transformation.

### <a name="Res-casts"></a>ES.48: Avoid casts

##### Reason

Casts are a well-known source of errors and make some optimizations unreliable.

##### Example, bad

    double d = 2;
    auto p = (long*)&d;
    auto q = (long long*)&d;
    cout << d << ' ' << *p << ' ' << *q << '\n';

What would you think this fragment prints? The result is at best implementation defined. I got

    2 0 4611686018427387904

Adding

    *q = 666;
    cout << d << ' ' << *p << ' ' << *q << '\n';

I got

    3.29048e-321 666 666

Surprised? I'm just glad I didn't crash the program.

##### Note

Programmers who write casts typically assume that they know what they are doing,
or that writing a cast makes the program "easier to read".
In fact, they often disable the general rules for using values.
Overload resolution and template instantiation usually pick the right function if there is a right function to pick.
If there is not, maybe there ought to be, rather than applying a local fix (cast).

##### Notes

Casts are necessary in a systems programming language.  For example, how else
would we get the address of a device register into a pointer?  However, casts
are seriously overused as well as a major source of errors.

If you feel the need for a lot of casts, there might be a fundamental design problem.

The [type profile](#Pro-type-reinterpretcast) bans `reinterpret_cast` and C-style casts.

Never cast to `(void)` to ignore a `[[nodiscard]]`return value.
If you deliberately want to discard such a result, first think hard about whether that is really a good idea (there is usually a good reason the author of the function or of the return type used `[[nodiscard]]` in the first place).
If you still think it's appropriate and your code reviewer agrees, use `std::ignore =` to turn off the warning which is simple, portable, and easy to grep.

##### Alternatives

Casts are widely (mis)used. Modern C++ has rules and constructs that eliminate the need for casts in many contexts, such as

* Use templates
* Use `std::variant`
* Rely on the well-defined, safe, implicit conversions between pointer types
* Use `std::ignore =` to ignore `[[nodiscard]]` values.

##### Enforcement

* Flag all C-style casts, including to `void`.
* Flag functional style casts using `Type(value)`. Use `Type{value}` instead which is not narrowing. (See [ES.64](#Res-construct).)
* Flag [identity casts](#Pro-type-identitycast) between pointer types, where the source and target types are the same (#Pro-type-identitycast).
* Flag an explicit pointer cast that could be [implicit](#Pro-type-implicitpointercast).

### <a name="Res-casts-named"></a>ES.49: If you must use a cast, use a named cast

##### Reason

Readability. Error avoidance.
Named casts are more specific than a C-style or functional cast, allowing the compiler to catch some errors.

The named casts are:

* `static_cast`
* `const_cast`
* `reinterpret_cast`
* `dynamic_cast`
* `std::move`         // `move(x)` is an rvalue reference to `x`
* `std::forward`      // `forward<T>(x)` is an rvalue or an lvalue reference to `x` depending on `T`
* `gsl::narrow_cast`  // `narrow_cast<T>(x)` is `static_cast<T>(x)`
* `gsl::narrow`       // `narrow<T>(x)` is `static_cast<T>(x)` if `static_cast<T>(x) == x` or it throws `narrowing_error`

##### Example

    class B { /* ... */ };
    class D { /* ... */ };

    template<typename D> D* upcast(B* pb)
    {
        D* pd0 = pb;                        // error: no implicit conversion from B* to D*
        D* pd1 = (D*)pb;                    // legal, but what is done?
        D* pd2 = static_cast<D*>(pb);       // error: D is not derived from B
        D* pd3 = reinterpret_cast<D*>(pb);  // OK: on your head be it!
        D* pd4 = dynamic_cast<D*>(pb);      // OK: return nullptr
        // ...
    }

The example was synthesized from real-world bugs where `D` used to be derived from `B`, but someone refactored the hierarchy.
The C-style cast is dangerous because it can do any kind of conversion, depriving us of any protection from mistakes (now or in the future).

##### Note

When converting between types with no information loss (e.g. from `float` to
`double` or from `int32` to `int64`), brace initialization might be used instead.

    double d {some_float};
    int64_t i {some_int32};

This makes it clear that the type conversion was intended and also prevents
conversions between types that might result in loss of precision. (It is a
compilation error to try to initialize a `float` from a `double` in this fashion,
for example.)

##### Note

`reinterpret_cast` can be essential, but the essential uses (e.g., turning a machine address into pointer) are not type safe:

    auto p = reinterpret_cast<Device_register>(0x800);  // inherently dangerous


##### Enforcement

* Flag all C-style casts, including to `void`.
* Flag functional style casts using `Type(value)`. Use `Type{value}` instead which is not narrowing. (See [ES.64](#Res-construct).)
* The [type profile](#Pro-type-reinterpretcast) bans `reinterpret_cast`.
* The [type profile](#Pro-type-arithmeticcast) warns when using `static_cast` between arithmetic types.

### <a name="Res-casts-const"></a>ES.50: Don't cast away `const`

##### Reason

It makes a lie out of `const`.
If the variable is actually declared `const`, modifying it results in undefined behavior.

##### Example, bad

    void f(const int& x)
    {
        const_cast<int&>(x) = 42;   // BAD
    }

    static int i = 0;
    static const int j = 0;

    f(i); // silent side effect
    f(j); // undefined behavior

##### Example

Sometimes, you might be tempted to resort to `const_cast` to avoid code duplication, such as when two accessor functions that differ only in `const`-ness have similar implementations. For example:

    class Bar;

    class Foo {
    public:
        // BAD, duplicates logic
        Bar& get_bar()
        {
            /* complex logic around getting a non-const reference to my_bar */
        }

        const Bar& get_bar() const
        {
            /* same complex logic around getting a const reference to my_bar */
        }
    private:
        Bar my_bar;
    };

Instead, prefer to share implementations. Normally, you can just have the non-`const` function call the `const` function. However, when there is complex logic this can lead to the following pattern that still resorts to a `const_cast`:

    class Foo {
    public:
        // not great, non-const calls const version but resorts to const_cast
        Bar& get_bar()
        {
            return const_cast<Bar&>(static_cast<const Foo&>(*this).get_bar());
        }
        const Bar& get_bar() const
        {
            /* the complex logic around getting a const reference to my_bar */
        }
    private:
        Bar my_bar;
    };

Although this pattern is safe when applied correctly, because the caller must have had a non-`const` object to begin with, it's not ideal because the safety is hard to enforce automatically as a checker rule.

Instead, prefer to put the common code in a common helper function -- and make it a template so that it deduces `const`. This doesn't use any `const_cast` at all:

    class Foo {
    public:                         // good
              Bar& get_bar()       { return get_bar_impl(*this); }
        const Bar& get_bar() const { return get_bar_impl(*this); }
    private:
        Bar my_bar;

        template<class T>           // good, deduces whether T is const or non-const
        static auto& get_bar_impl(T& t)
            { /* the complex logic around getting a possibly-const reference to my_bar */ }
    };

Note: Don't do large non-dependent work inside a template, which leads to code bloat. For example, a further improvement would be if all or part of `get_bar_impl` can be non-dependent and factored out into a common non-template function, for a potentially big reduction in code size.

##### Exception

You might need to cast away `const` when calling `const`-incorrect functions.
Prefer to wrap such functions in inline `const`-correct wrappers to encapsulate the cast in one place.

##### Example

Sometimes, "cast away `const`" is to allow the updating of some transient information of an otherwise immutable object.
Examples are caching, memoization, and precomputation.
Such examples are often handled as well or better using `mutable` or an indirection than with a `const_cast`.

Consider keeping previously computed results around for a costly operation:

    int compute(int x); // compute a value for x; assume this to be costly

    class Cache {   // some type implementing a cache for an int->int operation
    public:
        pair<bool, int> find(int x) const;   // is there a value for x?
        void set(int x, int v);             // make y the value for x
        // ...
    private:
        // ...
    };

    class X {
    public:
        int get_val(int x)
        {
            auto p = cache.find(x);
            if (p.first) return p.second;
            int val = compute(x);
            cache.set(x, val); // insert value for x
            return val;
        }
        // ...
    private:
        Cache cache;
    };

Here, `get_val()` is logically constant, so we would like to make it a `const` member.
To do this we still need to mutate `cache`, so people sometimes resort to a `const_cast`:

    class X {   // Suspicious solution based on casting
    public:
        int get_val(int x) const
        {
            auto p = cache.find(x);
            if (p.first) return p.second;
            int val = compute(x);
            const_cast<Cache&>(cache).set(x, val);   // ugly
            return val;
        }
        // ...
    private:
        Cache cache;
    };

Fortunately, there is a better solution:
State that `cache` is mutable even for a `const` object:

    class X {   // better solution
    public:
        int get_val(int x) const
        {
            auto p = cache.find(x);
            if (p.first) return p.second;
            int val = compute(x);
            cache.set(x, val);
            return val;
        }
        // ...
    private:
        mutable Cache cache;
    };

An alternative solution would be to store a pointer to the `cache`:

    class X {   // OK, but slightly messier solution
    public:
        int get_val(int x) const
        {
            auto p = cache->find(x);
            if (p.first) return p.second;
            int val = compute(x);
            cache->set(x, val);
            return val;
        }
        // ...
    private:
        unique_ptr<Cache> cache;
    };

That solution is the most flexible, but requires explicit construction and destruction of `*cache`
(most likely in the constructor and destructor of `X`).

In any variant, we must guard against data races on the `cache` in multi-threaded code, possibly using a `std::mutex`.

##### Enforcement

* Flag `const_cast`s.
* This rule is part of the [type-safety profile](#Pro-type-constcast) for the related Profile.

### <a name="Res-range-checking"></a>ES.55: Avoid the need for range checking

##### Reason

Constructs that cannot overflow do not overflow (and usually run faster):

##### Example

    for (auto& x : v)      // print all elements of v
        cout << x << '\n';

    auto p = find(v, x);   // find x in v

##### Enforcement

Look for explicit range checks and heuristically suggest alternatives.

### <a name="Res-move"></a>ES.56: Write `std::move()` only when you need to explicitly move an object to another scope

##### Reason

We move, rather than copy, to avoid duplication and for improved performance.

A move typically leaves behind an empty object ([C.64](#Rc-move-semantic)), which can be surprising or even dangerous, so we try to avoid moving from lvalues (they might be accessed later).

##### Notes

Moving is done implicitly when the source is an rvalue (e.g., value in a `return` treatment or a function result), so don't pointlessly complicate code in those cases by writing `move` explicitly. Instead, write short functions that return values, and both the function's return and the caller's accepting of the return will be optimized naturally.

In general, following the guidelines in this document (including not making variables' scopes needlessly large, writing short functions that return values, returning local variables) help eliminate most need for explicit `std::move`.

Explicit `move` is needed to explicitly move an object to another scope, notably to pass it to a "sink" function and in the implementations of the move operations themselves (move constructor, move assignment operator) and swap operations.

##### Example, bad

    void sink(X&& x);   // sink takes ownership of x

    void user()
    {
        X x;
        // error: cannot bind an lvalue to a rvalue reference
        sink(x);
        // OK: sink takes the contents of x, x must now be assumed to be empty
        sink(std::move(x));

        // ...

        // probably a mistake
        use(x);
    }

Usually, a `std::move()` is used as an argument to a `&&` parameter.
And after you do that, assume the object has been moved from (see [C.64](#Rc-move-semantic)) and don't read its state again until you first set it to a new value.

    void f()
    {
        string s1 = "supercalifragilisticexpialidocious";

        string s2 = s1;             // ok, takes a copy
        assert(s1 == "supercalifragilisticexpialidocious");  // ok

        // bad, if you want to keep using s1's value
        string s3 = move(s1);

        // bad, assert will likely fail, s1 likely changed
        assert(s1 == "supercalifragilisticexpialidocious");
    }

##### Example

    void sink(unique_ptr<widget> p);  // pass ownership of p to sink()

    void f()
    {
        auto w = make_unique<widget>();
        // ...
        sink(std::move(w));               // ok, give to sink()
        // ...
        sink(w);    // Error: unique_ptr is carefully designed so that you cannot copy it
    }

##### Notes

`std::move()` is a cast to `&&` in disguise; it doesn't itself move anything, but marks a named object as a candidate that can be moved from.
The language already knows the common cases where objects can be moved from, especially when returning values from functions, so don't complicate code with redundant `std::move()`'s.

Never write `std::move()` just because you've heard "it's more efficient."
In general, don't believe claims of "efficiency" without data (???).
In general, don't complicate your code without reason (??).
Never write `std::move()` on a const object, it is silently transformed into a copy (see Item 23 in [Meyers15](#Meyers15))

##### Example, bad

    vector<int> make_vector()
    {
        vector<int> result;
        // ... load result with data
        return std::move(result);       // bad; just write "return result;"
    }

Never write `return move(local_variable);`, because the language already knows the variable is a move candidate.
Writing `move` in this code won't help, and can actually be detrimental because on some compilers it interferes with RVO (the return value optimization) by creating an additional reference alias to the local variable.


##### Example, bad

    vector<int> v = std::move(make_vector());   // bad; the std::move is entirely redundant

Never write `move` on a returned value such as `x = move(f());` where `f` returns by value.
The language already knows that a returned value is a temporary object that can be moved from.

##### Example

    void mover(X&& x)
    {
        call_something(std::move(x));         // ok
        call_something(std::forward<X>(x));   // bad, don't std::forward an rvalue reference
        call_something(x);                    // suspicious, why not std::move?
    }

    template<class T>
    void forwarder(T&& t)
    {
        call_something(std::move(t));         // bad, don't std::move a forwarding reference
        call_something(std::forward<T>(t));   // ok
        call_something(t);                    // suspicious, why not std::forward?
    }

##### Enforcement

* Flag use of `std::move(x)` where `x` is an rvalue or the language will already treat it as an rvalue, including `return std::move(local_variable);` and `std::move(f())` on a function that returns by value.
* Flag functions taking an `S&&` parameter if there is no `const S&` overload to take care of lvalues.
* Flag a `std::move`d argument passed to a parameter, except when the parameter type is an `X&&` rvalue reference or the type is move-only and the parameter is passed by value.
* Flag when `std::move` is applied to a forwarding reference (`T&&` where `T` is a template parameter type). Use `std::forward` instead.
* Flag when `std::move` is applied to other than an rvalue reference to non-const. (More general case of the previous rule to cover the non-forwarding cases.)
* Flag when `std::forward` is applied to an rvalue reference (`X&&` where `X` is a non-template parameter type). Use `std::move` instead.
* Flag when `std::forward` is applied to other than a forwarding reference. (More general case of the previous rule to cover the non-moving cases.)
* Flag when an object is potentially moved from and the next operation is a `const` operation; there should first be an intervening non-`const` operation, ideally assignment, to first reset the object's value.

### <a name="Res-new"></a>ES.60: Avoid `new` and `delete` outside resource management functions

##### Reason

Direct resource management in application code is error-prone and tedious.

##### Note

This is also known as the rule of "No naked `new`!"

##### Example, bad

    void f(int n)
    {
        auto p = new X[n];   // n default constructed Xs
        // ...
        delete[] p;
    }

There can be code in the `...` part that causes the `delete` never to happen.

**See also**: [R: Resource management](#S-resource)

##### Enforcement

Flag naked `new`s and naked `delete`s.

### <a name="Res-del"></a>ES.61: Delete arrays using `delete[]` and non-arrays using `delete`

##### Reason

That's what the language requires, and mismatches can lead to resource release errors and/or memory corruption.

##### Example, bad

    void f(int n)
    {
        auto p = new X[n];   // n default constructed Xs
        // ...
        delete p;   // error: just delete the object p, rather than delete the array p[]
    }

##### Note

This example not only violates the [no naked `new` rule](#Res-new) as in the previous example, it has many more problems.

##### Enforcement

* Flag mismatched `new` and `delete` if they are in the same scope.
* Flag mismatched `new` and `delete` if they are in a constructor/destructor pair.

### <a name="Res-arr2"></a>ES.62: Don't compare pointers into different arrays

##### Reason

The result of doing so is undefined.

##### Example, bad

    void f()
    {
        int a1[7];
        int a2[9];
        if (&a1[5] < &a2[7]) {}       // bad: undefined
        if (0 < &a1[5] - &a2[7]) {}   // bad: undefined
    }

##### Note

This example has many more problems.

##### Enforcement

???

### <a name="Res-slice"></a>ES.63: Don't slice

##### Reason

Slicing -- that is, copying only part of an object using assignment or initialization -- most often leads to errors because
the object was meant to be considered as a whole.
In the rare cases where the slicing was deliberate the code can be surprising.

##### Example

    class Shape { /* ... */ };
    class Circle : public Shape { /* ... */ Point c; int r; };

    Circle c { {0, 0}, 42 };
    Shape s {c};    // copy construct only the Shape part of Circle
    s = c;          // or copy assign only the Shape part of Circle

    void assign(const Shape& src, Shape& dest)
    {
        dest = src;
    }
    Circle c2 { {1, 1}, 43 };
    assign(c, c2);   // oops, not the whole state is transferred
    assert(c == c2); // if we supply copying, we should also provide comparison,
                     // but this will likely return false

The result will be meaningless because the center and radius will not be copied from `c` into `s`.
The first defense against this is to [define the base class `Shape` not to allow this](#Rc-copy-virtual).

##### Alternative

If you mean to slice, define an explicit operation to do so.
This saves readers from confusion.
For example:

    class Smiley : public Circle {
        public:
        Circle copy_circle();
        // ...
    };

    Smiley sm { /* ... */ };
    Circle c1 {sm};  // ideally prevented by the definition of Circle
    Circle c2 {sm.copy_circle()};

##### Enforcement

Warn against slicing.

### <a name="Res-construct"></a>ES.64: Use the `T{e}`notation for construction

##### Reason

The `T{e}` construction syntax makes it explicit that construction is desired.
The `T{e}` construction syntax doesn't allow narrowing.
`T{e}` is the only safe and general expression for constructing a value of type `T` from an expression `e`.
The casts notations `T(e)` and `(T)e` are neither safe nor general.

##### Example

For built-in types, the construction notation protects against narrowing and reinterpretation

    void use(char ch, int i, double d, char* p, long long lng)
    {
        int x1 = int{ch};     // OK, but redundant
        int x2 = int{d};      // error: double->int narrowing; use a cast if you need to
        int x3 = int{p};      // error: pointer to->int; use a reinterpret_cast if you really need to
        int x4 = int{lng};    // error: long long->int narrowing; use a cast if you need to

        int y1 = int(ch);     // OK, but redundant
        int y2 = int(d);      // bad: double->int narrowing; use a cast if you need to
        int y3 = int(p);      // bad: pointer to->int; use a reinterpret_cast if you really need to
        int y4 = int(lng);    // bad: long long->int narrowing; use a cast if you need to

        int z1 = (int)ch;     // OK, but redundant
        int z2 = (int)d;      // bad: double->int narrowing; use a cast if you need to
        int z3 = (int)p;      // bad: pointer to->int; use a reinterpret_cast if you really need to
        int z4 = (int)lng;    // bad: long long->int narrowing; use a cast if you need to
    }

The integer to/from pointer conversions are implementation defined when using the `T(e)` or `(T)e` notations, and non-portable
between platforms with different integer and pointer sizes.

##### Note

[Avoid casts](#Res-casts) (explicit type conversion) and if you must [prefer named casts](#Res-casts-named).

##### Note

When unambiguous, the `T` can be left out of `T{e}`.

    complex<double> f(complex<double>);

    auto z = f({2*pi, 1});

##### Note

The construction notation is the most general [initializer notation](#Res-list).

##### Exception

`std::vector` and other containers were defined before we had `{}` as a notation for construction.
Consider:

    vector<string> vs {10};                           // ten empty strings
    vector<int> vi1 {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10};  // ten elements 1..10
    vector<int> vi2 {10};                             // one element with the value 10

How do we get a `vector` of 10 default initialized `int`s?

    vector<int> v3(10); // ten elements with value 0

The use of `()` rather than `{}` for number of elements is conventional (going back to the early 1980s), hard to change, but still
a design error: for a container where the element type can be confused with the number of elements, we have an ambiguity that
must be resolved.
The conventional resolution is to interpret `{10}` as a list of one element and use `(10)` to distinguish a size.

This mistake need not be repeated in new code.
We can define a type to represent the number of elements:

    struct Count { int n; };

    template<typename T>
    class Vector {
    public:
        Vector(Count n);                     // n default-initialized elements
        Vector(initializer_list<T> init);    // init.size() elements
        // ...
    };

    Vector<int> v1{10};
    Vector<int> v2{Count{10}};
    Vector<Count> v3{Count{10}};    // yes, there is still a very minor problem

The main problem left is to find a suitable name for `Count`.

##### Enforcement

Flag the C-style `(T)e` and functional-style `T(e)` casts.


### <a name="Res-deref"></a>ES.65: Don't dereference an invalid pointer

##### Reason

Dereferencing an invalid pointer, such as `nullptr`, is undefined behavior, typically leading to immediate crashes,
wrong results, or memory corruption.

##### Note

By pointer here we mean any indirection to an object, including equivalently an iterator or view.

##### Note

This rule is an obvious and well-known language rule, but can be hard to follow.
It takes good coding style, library support, and static analysis to eliminate violations without major overhead.
This is a major part of the discussion of [C++'s model for type- and resource-safety](#Stroustrup15).

**See also**:

* Use [RAII](#Rr-raii) to avoid lifetime problems.
* Use [unique_ptr](#Rf-unique_ptr) to avoid lifetime problems.
* Use [shared_ptr](#Rf-shared_ptr) to avoid lifetime problems.
* Use [references](#Rf-ptr-ref) when `nullptr` isn't a possibility.
* Use [not_null](#Rf-nullptr) to catch unexpected `nullptr` early.
* Use the [bounds profile](#SS-bounds) to avoid range errors.


##### Example

    void f()
    {
        int x = 0;
        int* p = &x;

        if (condition()) {
            int y = 0;
            p = &y;
        } // invalidates p

        *p = 42;            // BAD, p might be invalid if the branch was taken
    }

To resolve the problem, either extend the lifetime of the object the pointer is intended to refer to, or shorten the lifetime of the pointer (move the dereference to before the pointed-to object's lifetime ends).

    void f1()
    {
        int x = 0;
        int* p = &x;

        int y = 0;
        if (condition()) {
            p = &y;
        }

        *p = 42;            // OK, p points to x or y and both are still in scope
    }

Unfortunately, most invalid pointer problems are harder to spot and harder to fix.

##### Example

    void f(int* p)
    {
        int x = *p; // BAD: how do we know that p is valid?
    }

There is a huge amount of such code.
Most works -- after lots of testing -- but in isolation it is impossible to tell whether `p` could be the `nullptr`.
Consequently, this is also a major source of errors.
There are many approaches to dealing with this potential problem:

    void f1(int* p) // deal with nullptr
    {
        if (!p) {
            // deal with nullptr (allocate, return, throw, make p point to something, whatever
        }
        int x = *p;
    }

There are two potential problems with testing for `nullptr`:

* it is not always obvious what to do if we find `nullptr`
* the test can be redundant and/or relatively expensive
* it is not obvious if the test is to protect against a violation or part of the required logic.

<!-- comment needed for code block after list -->
    void f2(int* p) // state that p is not supposed to be nullptr
    {
        assert(p);
        int x = *p;
    }

This would carry a cost only when the assertion checking was enabled and would give a compiler/analyzer useful information.
This would work even better if/when C++ gets direct support for contracts:

    void f3(int* p) // state that p is not supposed to be nullptr
        [[expects: p]]
    {
        int x = *p;
    }

Alternatively, we could use `gsl::not_null` to ensure that `p` is not the `nullptr`.

    void f(not_null<int*> p)
    {
        int x = *p;
    }

These remedies take care of `nullptr` only.
Remember that there are other ways of getting an invalid pointer.

##### Example

    void f(int* p)  // old code, doesn't use owner
    {
        delete p;
    }

    void g()        // old code: uses naked new
    {
        auto q = new int{7};
        f(q);
        int x = *q; // BAD: dereferences invalid pointer
    }

##### Example

    void f()
    {
        vector<int> v(10);
        int* p = &v[5];
        v.push_back(99); // could reallocate v's elements
        int x = *p; // BAD: dereferences potentially invalid pointer
    }

##### Enforcement

This rule is part of the [lifetime safety profile](#SS-lifetime)

* Flag a dereference of a pointer that points to an object that has gone out of scope
* Flag a dereference of a pointer that might have been invalidated by assigning a `nullptr`
* Flag a dereference of a pointer that might have been invalidated by a `delete`
* Flag a dereference to a pointer to a container element that might have been invalidated by dereference


## ES.stmt: Statements

Statements control the flow of control (except for function calls and exception throws, which are expressions).

### <a name="Res-switch-if"></a>ES.70: Prefer a `switch`-statement to an `if`-statement when there is a choice

##### Reason

* Readability.
* Efficiency: A `switch` compares against constants and is usually better optimized than a series of tests in an `if`-`then`-`else` chain.
* A `switch` enables some heuristic consistency checking. For example, have all values of an `enum` been covered? If not, is there a `default`?

##### Example

    void use(int n)
    {
        switch (n) {   // good
        case 0:
            // ...
            break;
        case 7:
            // ...
            break;
        default:
            // ...
            break;
        }
    }

rather than:

    void use2(int n)
    {
        if (n == 0)   // bad: if-then-else chain comparing against a set of constants
            // ...
        else if (n == 7)
            // ...
    }

##### Enforcement

Flag `if`-`then`-`else` chains that check against constants (only).

### <a name="Res-for-range"></a>ES.71: Prefer a range-`for`-statement to a `for`-statement when there is a choice

##### Reason

Readability. Error prevention. Efficiency.

##### Example

    for (gsl::index i = 0; i < v.size(); ++i)   // bad
        cout << v[i] << '\n';

    for (auto p = v.begin(); p != v.end(); ++p)   // bad
        cout << *p << '\n';

    for (auto& x : v)    // OK
        cout << x << '\n';

    for (gsl::index i = 1; i < v.size(); ++i) // touches two elements: can't be a range-for
        cout << v[i] + v[i - 1] << '\n';

    for (gsl::index i = 0; i < v.size(); ++i) // possible side effect: can't be a range-for
        cout << f(v, &v[i]) << '\n';

    for (gsl::index i = 0; i < v.size(); ++i) { // body messes with loop variable: can't be a range-for
        if (i % 2 != 0)
            cout << v[i] << '\n'; // output odd elements
    }

A human or a good static analyzer might determine that there really isn't a side effect on `v` in `f(v, &v[i])` so that the loop can be rewritten.

"Messing with the loop variable" in the body of a loop is typically best avoided.

##### Note

Don't use expensive copies of the loop variable of a range-`for` loop:

    for (string s : vs) // ...

This will copy each element of `vs` into `s`. Better:

    for (string& s : vs) // ...

Better still, if the loop variable isn't modified or copied:

    for (const string& s : vs) // ...

##### Enforcement

Look at loops, if a traditional loop just looks at each element of a sequence, and there are no side effects on what it does with the elements, rewrite the loop to a ranged-`for` loop.

### <a name="Res-for-while"></a>ES.72: Prefer a `for`-statement to a `while`-statement when there is an obvious loop variable

##### Reason

Readability: the complete logic of the loop is visible "up front". The scope of the loop variable can be limited.

##### Example

    for (gsl::index i = 0; i < vec.size(); i++) {
        // do work
    }

##### Example, bad

    int i = 0;
    while (i < vec.size()) {
        // do work
        i++;
    }

##### Enforcement

???

### <a name="Res-while-for"></a>ES.73: Prefer a `while`-statement to a `for`-statement when there is no obvious loop variable

##### Reason

Readability.

##### Example

    int events = 0;
    for (; wait_for_event(); ++events) {  // bad, confusing
        // ...
    }

The "event loop" is misleading because the `events` counter has nothing to do with the loop condition (`wait_for_event()`).
Better

    int events = 0;
    while (wait_for_event()) {      // better
        ++events;
        // ...
    }

##### Enforcement

Flag actions in `for`-initializers and `for`-increments that do not relate to the `for`-condition.

### <a name="Res-for-init"></a>ES.74: Prefer to declare a loop variable in the initializer part of a `for`-statement

See [ES.6](#Res-cond)

### <a name="Res-do"></a>ES.75: Avoid `do`-statements

##### Reason

Readability, avoidance of errors.
The termination condition is at the end (where it can be overlooked) and the condition is not checked the first time through.

##### Example

    int x;
    do {
        cin >> x;
        // ...
    } while (x < 0);

##### Note

Yes, there are genuine examples where a `do`-statement is a clear statement of a solution, but also many bugs.

##### Enforcement

Flag `do`-statements.

### <a name="Res-goto"></a>ES.76: Avoid `goto`

##### Reason

Readability, avoidance of errors. There are better control structures for humans; `goto` is for machine generated code.

##### Exception

Breaking out of a nested loop.
In that case, always jump forwards.

    for (int i = 0; i < imax; ++i)
        for (int j = 0; j < jmax; ++j) {
            if (a[i][j] > elem_max) goto finished;
            // ...
        }
    finished:
    // ...

##### Example, bad

There is a fair amount of use of the C goto-exit idiom:

    void f()
    {
        // ...
            goto exit;
        // ...
            goto exit;
        // ...
    exit:
        // ... common cleanup code ...
    }

This is an ad-hoc simulation of destructors.
Declare your resources with handles with destructors that clean up.
If for some reason you cannot handle all cleanup with destructors for the variables used,
consider `gsl::finally()` as a cleaner and more reliable alternative to `goto exit`

##### Enforcement

* Flag `goto`. Better still flag all `goto`s that do not jump from a nested loop to the statement immediately after a nest of loops.

### <a name="Res-continue"></a>ES.77: Minimize the use of `break` and `continue` in loops

##### Reason

 In a non-trivial loop body, it is easy to overlook a `break` or a `continue`.

 A `break` in a loop has a dramatically different meaning than a `break` in a `switch`-statement
 (and you can have `switch`-statement in a loop and a loop in a `switch`-case).

##### Example

    switch(x) {
    case 1 :
        while (/* some condition */) {
            // ...
        break;
        } // Oops! break switch or break while intended?
    case 2 :
        // ...
        break;
    }

##### Alternative

Often, a loop that requires a `break` is a good candidate for a function (algorithm), in which case the `break` becomes a `return`.

    //Original code: break inside loop
    void use1()
    {
        std::vector<T> vec = {/* initialized with some values */};
        T value;
        for (const T item : vec) {
            if (/* some condition*/) {
                value = item;
                break;
            }
        }
        /* then do something with value */
    }

    //BETTER: create a function and return inside loop
    T search(const std::vector<T> &vec)
    {
        for (const T &item : vec) {
            if (/* some condition*/) return item;
        }
        return T(); //default value
    }

    void use2()
    {
        std::vector<T> vec = {/* initialized with some values */};
        T value = search(vec);
        /* then do something with value */
    }

Often, a loop that uses `continue` can equivalently and as clearly be expressed by an `if`-statement.

    for (int item : vec) {  // BAD
        if (item%2 == 0) continue;
        if (item == 5) continue;
        if (item > 10) continue;
        /* do something with item */
    }

    for (int item : vec) {  // GOOD
        if (item%2 != 0 && item != 5 && item <= 10) {
            /* do something with item */
        }
    }

##### Note

If you really need to break out a loop, a `break` is typically better than alternatives such as [modifying the loop variable](#Res-loop-counter) or a [`goto`](#Res-goto):


##### Enforcement

### <a name="Res-break"></a>ES.78: Don't rely on implicit fallthrough in `switch` statements

##### Reason

Always end a non-empty `case` with a `break`. Accidentally leaving out a `break` is a fairly common bug.
A deliberate fallthrough can be a maintenance hazard and should be rare and explicit.

##### Example

    switch (eventType) {
    case Information:
        update_status_bar();
        break;
    case Warning:
        write_event_log();
        // Bad - implicit fallthrough
    case Error:
        display_error_window();
        break;
    }

Multiple case labels of a single statement is OK:

    switch (x) {
    case 'a':
    case 'b':
    case 'f':
        do_something(x);
        break;
    }

Return statements in a case label are also OK:

    switch (x) {
    case 'a':
        return 1;
    case 'b':
        return 2;
    case 'c':
        return 3;
    }

##### Exceptions

In rare cases if fallthrough is deemed appropriate, be explicit and use the `[[fallthrough]]` annotation:

    switch (eventType) {
    case Information:
        update_status_bar();
        break;
    case Warning:
        write_event_log();
        [[fallthrough]];
    case Error:
        display_error_window();
        break;
    }

##### Note

##### Enforcement

Flag all implicit fallthroughs from non-empty `case`s.


### <a name="Res-default"></a>ES.79: Use `default` to handle common cases (only)

##### Reason

 Code clarity.
 Improved opportunities for error detection.

##### Example

    enum E { a, b, c, d };

    void f1(E x)
    {
        switch (x) {
        case a:
            do_something();
            break;
        case b:
            do_something_else();
            break;
        default:
            take_the_default_action();
            break;
        }
    }

Here it is clear that there is a default action and that cases `a` and `b` are special.

##### Example

But what if there is no default action and you mean to handle only specific cases?
In that case, have an empty default or else it is impossible to know if you meant to handle all cases:

    void f2(E x)
    {
        switch (x) {
        case a:
            do_something();
            break;
        case b:
            do_something_else();
            break;
        default:
            // do nothing for the rest of the cases
            break;
        }
    }

If you leave out the `default`, a maintainer and/or a compiler might reasonably assume that you intended to handle all cases:

    void f2(E x)
    {
        switch (x) {
        case a:
            do_something();
            break;
        case b:
        case c:
            do_something_else();
            break;
        }
    }

Did you forget case `d` or deliberately leave it out?
Forgetting a case typically happens when a case is added to an enumeration and the person doing so fails to add it to every
switch over the enumerators.

##### Enforcement

Flag `switch`-statements over an enumeration that don't handle all enumerators and do not have a `default`.
This might yield too many false positives in some code bases; if so, flag only `switch`es that handle most but not all cases
(that was the strategy of the very first C++ compiler).

### <a name="Res-noname"></a>ES.84: Don't try to declare a local variable with no name

##### Reason

There is no such thing.
What looks to a human like a variable without a name is to the compiler a statement consisting of a temporary that immediately goes out of scope.

##### Example, bad

    void f()
    {
        lock_guard<mutex>{mx};   // Bad
        // ...
    }

This declares an unnamed `lock_guard` object that immediately goes out of scope at the point of the semicolon.
This is not an uncommon mistake.
In particular, this particular example can lead to hard-to find race conditions.

##### Note

Unnamed function arguments are fine.

##### Enforcement

Flag statements that are just a temporary.

### <a name="Res-empty"></a>ES.85: Make empty statements visible

##### Reason

Readability.

##### Example

    for (i = 0; i < max; ++i);   // BAD: the empty statement is easily overlooked
    v[i] = f(v[i]);

    for (auto x : v) {           // better
        // nothing
    }
    v[i] = f(v[i]);

##### Enforcement

Flag empty statements that are not blocks and don't contain comments.

### <a name="Res-loop-counter"></a>ES.86: Avoid modifying loop control variables inside the body of raw for-loops

##### Reason

The loop control up front should enable correct reasoning about what is happening inside the loop. Modifying loop counters in both the iteration-expression and inside the body of the loop is a perennial source of surprises and bugs.

##### Example

    for (int i = 0; i < 10; ++i) {
        // no updates to i -- ok
    }

    for (int i = 0; i < 10; ++i) {
        //
        if (/* something */) ++i; // BAD
        //
    }

    bool skip = false;
    for (int i = 0; i < 10; ++i) {
        if (skip) { skip = false; continue; }
        //
        if (/* something */) skip = true;  // Better: using two variables for two concepts.
        //
    }

##### Enforcement

Flag variables that are potentially updated (have a non-`const` use) in both the loop control iteration-expression and the loop body.


### <a name="Res-if"></a>ES.87: Don't add redundant `==` or `!=` to conditions

##### Reason

Doing so avoids verbosity and eliminates some opportunities for mistakes.
Helps make style consistent and conventional.

##### Example

By definition, a condition in an `if`-statement, `while`-statement, or a `for`-statement selects between `true` and `false`.
A numeric value is compared to `0` and a pointer value to `nullptr`.

    // These all mean "if p is not nullptr"
    if (p) { ... }            // good
    if (p != 0) { ... }       // redundant !=0, bad: don't use 0 for pointers
    if (p != nullptr) { ... } // redundant !=nullptr, not recommended

Often, `if (p)` is read as "if `p` is valid" which is a direct expression of the programmers intent,
whereas `if (p != nullptr)` would be a long-winded workaround.

##### Example

This rule is especially useful when a declaration is used as a condition

    if (auto pc = dynamic_cast<Circle*>(ps)) { ... } // execute if ps points to a kind of Circle, good

    if (auto pc = dynamic_cast<Circle*>(ps); pc != nullptr) { ... } // not recommended

##### Example

Note that implicit conversions to bool are applied in conditions.
For example:

    for (string s; cin >> s; ) v.push_back(s);

This invokes `istream`'s `operator bool()`.

##### Note

Explicit comparison of an integer to `0` is in general not redundant.
The reason is that (as opposed to pointers and Booleans) an integer often has more than two reasonable values.
Furthermore `0` (zero) is often used to indicate success.
Consequently, it is best to be specific about the comparison.

    void f(int i)
    {
        if (i)            // suspect
        // ...
        if (i == success) // possibly better
        // ...
    }

Always remember that an integer can have more than two values.

##### Example, bad

It has been noted that

    if(strcmp(p1, p2)) { ... }   // are the two C-style strings equal? (mistake!)

is a common beginners error.
If you use C-style strings, you must know the `<cstring>` functions well.
Being verbose and writing

    if(strcmp(p1, p2) != 0) { ... }   // are the two C-style strings equal? (mistake!)

would not in itself save you.

##### Note

The opposite condition is most easily expressed using a negation:

    // These all mean "if p is nullptr"
    if (!p) { ... }           // good
    if (p == 0) { ... }       // redundant == 0, bad: don't use 0 for pointers
    if (p == nullptr) { ... } // redundant == nullptr, not recommended

##### Enforcement

Easy, just check for redundant use of `!=` and `==` in conditions.



## <a name="SS-numbers"></a>Arithmetic

### <a name="Res-mix"></a>ES.100: Don't mix signed and unsigned arithmetic

##### Reason

Avoid wrong results.

##### Example

    int x = -3;
    unsigned int y = 7;

    cout << x - y << '\n';  // unsigned result, possibly 4294967286
    cout << x + y << '\n';  // unsigned result: 4
    cout << x * y << '\n';  // unsigned result, possibly 4294967275

It is harder to spot the problem in more realistic examples.

##### Note

Unfortunately, C++ uses signed integers for array subscripts and the standard library uses unsigned integers for container subscripts.
This precludes consistency. Use `gsl::index` for subscripts; [see ES.107](#Res-subscripts).

##### Enforcement

* Compilers already know and sometimes warn.
* (To avoid noise) Do not flag on a mixed signed/unsigned comparison where one of the arguments is `sizeof` or a call to container `.size()` and the other is `ptrdiff_t`.


### <a name="Res-unsigned"></a>ES.101: Use unsigned types for bit manipulation

##### Reason

Unsigned types support bit manipulation without surprises from sign bits.

##### Example

    unsigned char x = 0b1010'1010;
    unsigned char y = ~x;   // y == 0b0101'0101;

##### Note

Unsigned types can also be useful for modular arithmetic.
However, if you want modular arithmetic add
comments as necessary noting the reliance on wraparound behavior, as such code
can be surprising for many programmers.

##### Enforcement

* Just about impossible in general because of the use of unsigned subscripts in the standard library
* ???

### <a name="Res-signed"></a>ES.102: Use signed types for arithmetic

##### Reason

Because most arithmetic is assumed to be signed;
`x - y` yields a negative number when `y > x` except in the rare cases where you really want modular arithmetic.

##### Example

Unsigned arithmetic can yield surprising results if you are not expecting it.
This is even more true for mixed signed and unsigned arithmetic.

    template<typename T, typename T2>
    T subtract(T x, T2 y)
    {
        return x - y;
    }

    void test()
    {
        int s = 5;
        unsigned int us = 5;
        cout << subtract(s, 7) << '\n';       // -2
        cout << subtract(us, 7u) << '\n';     // 4294967294
        cout << subtract(s, 7u) << '\n';      // -2
        cout << subtract(us, 7) << '\n';      // 4294967294
        cout << subtract(s, us + 2) << '\n';  // -2
        cout << subtract(us, s + 2) << '\n';  // 4294967294
    }

Here we have been very explicit about what's happening,
but if you had seen `us - (s + 2)` or `s += 2; ...; us - s`, would you reliably have suspected that the result would print as `4294967294`?

##### Exception

Use unsigned types if you really want modular arithmetic - add
comments as necessary noting the reliance on overflow behavior, as such code
is going to be surprising for many programmers.

##### Example

The standard library uses unsigned types for subscripts.
The built-in array uses signed types for subscripts.
This makes surprises (and bugs) inevitable.

    int a[10];
    for (int i = 0; i < 10; ++i) a[i] = i;
    vector<int> v(10);
    // compares signed to unsigned; some compilers warn, but we should not
    for (gsl::index i = 0; i < v.size(); ++i) v[i] = i;

    int a2[-2];         // error: negative size

    // OK, but the number of ints (4294967294) is so large that we should get an exception
    vector<int> v2(-2);

 Use `gsl::index` for subscripts; [see ES.107](#Res-subscripts).

##### Enforcement

* Flag mixed signed and unsigned arithmetic
* Flag results of unsigned arithmetic assigned to or printed as signed.
* Flag negative literals (e.g. `-2`) used as container subscripts.
* (To avoid noise) Do not flag on a mixed signed/unsigned comparison where one of the arguments is `sizeof` or a call to container `.size()` and the other is `ptrdiff_t`.


### <a name="Res-overflow"></a>ES.103: Don't overflow

##### Reason

Overflow usually makes your numeric algorithm meaningless.
Incrementing a value beyond a maximum value can lead to memory corruption and undefined behavior.

##### Example, bad

    int a[10];
    a[10] = 7;   // bad, array bounds overflow

    for (int n = 0; n <= 10; ++n)
        a[n] = 9;   // bad, array bounds overflow

##### Example, bad

    int n = numeric_limits<int>::max();
    int m = n + 1;   // bad, numeric overflow

##### Example, bad

    int area(int h, int w) { return h * w; }

    auto a = area(10'000'000, 100'000'000);   // bad, numeric overflow

##### Exception

Use unsigned types if you really want modular arithmetic.

**Alternative**: For critical applications that can afford some overhead, use a range-checked integer and/or floating-point type.

##### Enforcement

???

### <a name="Res-underflow"></a>ES.104: Don't underflow

##### Reason

Decrementing a value beyond a minimum value can lead to memory corruption and undefined behavior.

##### Example, bad

    int a[10];
    a[-2] = 7;   // bad

    int n = 101;
    while (n--)
        a[n - 1] = 9;   // bad (twice)

##### Exception

Use unsigned types if you really want modular arithmetic.

##### Enforcement

???

### <a name="Res-zero"></a>ES.105: Don't divide by integer zero

##### Reason

The result is undefined and probably a crash.

##### Note

This also applies to `%`.

##### Example, bad

    int divide(int a, int b)
    {
        // BAD, should be checked (e.g., in a precondition)
        return a / b;
    }

##### Example, good

    int divide(int a, int b)
    {
        // good, address via precondition (and replace with contracts once C++ gets them)
        Expects(b != 0);
        return a / b;
    }

    double divide(double a, double b)
    {
        // good, address via using double instead
        return a / b;
    }

**Alternative**: For critical applications that can afford some overhead, use a range-checked integer and/or floating-point type.

##### Enforcement

* Flag division by an integral value that could be zero


### <a name="Res-nonnegative"></a>ES.106: Don't try to avoid negative values by using `unsigned`

##### Reason

Choosing `unsigned` implies many changes to the usual behavior of integers, including modular arithmetic,
can suppress warnings related to overflow,
and opens the door for errors related to signed/unsigned mixes.
Using `unsigned` doesn't actually eliminate the possibility of negative values.

##### Example

    unsigned int u1 = -2;   // Valid: the value of u1 is 4294967294
    int i1 = -2;
    unsigned int u2 = i1;   // Valid: the value of u2 is 4294967294
    int i2 = u2;            // Valid: the value of i2 is -2

These problems with such (perfectly legal) constructs are hard to spot in real code and are the source of many real-world errors.
Consider:

    unsigned area(unsigned height, unsigned width) { return height*width; } // [see also](#Ri-expects)
    // ...
    int height;
    cin >> height;
    auto a = area(height, 2);   // if the input is -2 a becomes 4294967292

Remember that `-1` when assigned to an `unsigned int` becomes the largest `unsigned int`.
Also, since unsigned arithmetic is modular arithmetic the multiplication didn't overflow, it wrapped around.

##### Example

    unsigned max = 100000;    // "accidental typo", I mean to say 10'000
    unsigned short x = 100;
    while (x < max) x += 100; // infinite loop

Had `x` been a signed `short`, we could have warned about the undefined behavior upon overflow.

##### Alternatives

* use signed integers and check for `x >= 0`
* use a positive integer type
* use an integer subrange type
* `Assert(-1 < x)`

For example

    struct Positive {
        int val;
        Positive(int x) :val{x} { Assert(0 < x); }
        operator int() { return val; }
    };

    int f(Positive arg) { return arg; }

    int r1 = f(2);
    int r2 = f(-2);  // throws

##### Note

???

##### Enforcement

See ES.100 Enforcements.


### <a name="Res-subscripts"></a>ES.107: Don't use `unsigned` for subscripts, prefer `gsl::index`

##### Reason

To avoid signed/unsigned confusion.
To enable better optimization.
To enable better error detection.
To avoid the pitfalls with `auto` and `int`.

##### Example, bad

    vector<int> vec = /*...*/;

    for (int i = 0; i < vec.size(); i += 2)                    // might not be big enough
        cout << vec[i] << '\n';
    for (unsigned i = 0; i < vec.size(); i += 2)               // risk wraparound
        cout << vec[i] << '\n';
    for (auto i = 0; i < vec.size(); i += 2)                   // might not be big enough
        cout << vec[i] << '\n';
    for (vector<int>::size_type i = 0; i < vec.size(); i += 2) // verbose
        cout << vec[i] << '\n';
    for (auto i = vec.size()-1; i >= 0; i -= 2)                // bug
        cout << vec[i] << '\n';
    for (int i = vec.size()-1; i >= 0; i -= 2)                 // might not be big enough
        cout << vec[i] << '\n';

##### Example, good

    vector<int> vec = /*...*/;

    for (gsl::index i = 0; i < vec.size(); i += 2)             // ok
        cout << vec[i] << '\n';
    for (gsl::index i = vec.size()-1; i >= 0; i -= 2)          // ok
        cout << vec[i] << '\n';

##### Note

The built-in array allows signed subscripts.
The standard-library containers use unsigned subscripts.
Thus, no perfect and fully compatible solution is possible (unless and until the standard-library containers change to use signed subscripts someday in the future).
Given the known problems with unsigned and signed/unsigned mixtures, better stick to (signed) integers of a sufficient size, which is guaranteed by `gsl::index`.

##### Example

    template<typename T>
    struct My_container {
    public:
        // ...
        T& operator[](gsl::index i);    // not unsigned
        // ...
    };

##### Example

    ??? demonstrate improved code generation and potential for error detection ???

##### Alternatives

Alternatives for users

* use algorithms
* use range-for
* use iterators/pointers

##### Enforcement

* Very tricky as long as the standard-library containers get it wrong.
* (To avoid noise) Do not flag on a mixed signed/unsigned comparison where one of the arguments is `sizeof` or a call to container `.size()` and the other is `ptrdiff_t`.
